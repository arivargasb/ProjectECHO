1	I know I'm not, but that's okay.	1.3128333333333333
1	So thanks for joining us this morning, and I I asked a colleague of mine to give a presentation today on, Ah, diabetes.	1.3451666666666666
1	And the reason, um, you know, the Wuhan data suggested that the patients that had the worst outcome were those with cardiovascular disease and, um, you know, age over, you know, 50 60 70 and I went up for decades.	1.4873333333333332
1	Um, but what we noticed in our cohort of patients, the majority of patients that did poorly were actually diabetics and in potential obese diabetic.	1.758
1	So my question was, you know, what is there?	1.9233333333333331
1	Is there something specific about diabetes that's putting these patients at risk and do?	1.9858333333333331
1	Is there something that we haven't really talked about or, um, with this in particular?	2.056666666666666
1	So it's my pleasure to introduce.	2.133666666666667
1	Ah, my colleague, uh, met Bouchonville, who is an associate professor medicine.	2.1713333333333336
1	He's an associate director for project echoes.	2.277333333333333
1	So many of you may already know him, and he runs his own endocrine echo.	2.309833333333333
1	Um and so I'm going to present a case.	2.3713333333333333
1	Ah, patient that we, uh, got here and then I'll let Dr Bouchonville take over so we'll have our slides.	2.406
