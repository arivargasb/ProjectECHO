Why do people outside of hyperglycemia are there any other reasons why people with diabetes might have a higher complication rate those with COVID-19?
And so there's been a lot of interest lately in the, uh, potential role for the Renin Angiotensin system and ah, one thing we know, at least in mouse models of diabetes, so I mean, this could be the same case in humans where it's not completely known yet, but ACE expression.
So angiotensin converting enzyme, uh, is higher in the lungs of, ah, of mouse models of diabetes.
So it might be that that's the case in humans with diabetes as well, an activation of ace.
So A's expression eyes associated with inflammation.
It's associated with vasoconstriction.
That's why ace inhibitors does tend to lower BP but also associate with thrombosis, lung injury, fibrosis and edema.
All the things that kind of lead to to, uh what we see in COVID-19 is devastating complications of people with the infection.
So there might be higher a ACE expression in in the lungs of people with diabetes and ace2 might also play an important role in the in the disease process.
We know that ace2 is a target of ah cell entry, and I've got a schematic coming up, a figure that illustrates that.
And, uh, but ace2 might also play a role in, um, kind of moderating ace expression in people who have COVID-19 infection.
So ace2 is a counter regulatory, uh, enzyme that is kind of doing the opposite of everything.
That ace I just showed you was doing so decreased inflammation rather than increased inflammation.
And that's through suppression of TNF Alpha and some other mechanisms as well.
Anti fibrotic effects vasodilator addition rather than basal constriction.
And there's some evidence to suggest that ace2 might actually play a protective role in those with infection.
But the current thinking right now is that outcome might have a lot to do with the relative balance of Ace and ace2 so again, a stew being more protective even though.
It is a target for several entry, uh, playing a protective role in the setting of COVID-19 expression and again, playing more of, ah detrimental role for the reasons I just outlined and so, typically what happens whether a patient has diabetes or not.
Hopefully you can see my little mouse pointer here, my track pad.
So the virus binds with ace2 on the the epithelial cell of the, uh of the lung and is ah, this leads to cell entry, viral entry, replication and ace2 is actually down regulated so that your ace to ace2 ratio becomes less favorable aces is still there, but less ace2.
So it kind of trips the balance and leads to an increased risk of lung injury.
Now in patients with diabetes.
If it's true that humans with diabetes just like the mouse model that they have increased ace expression in the lung, then this is kind of a double whammy picture.
They have an even worse ace2 ratio, leading to increased lung injury and so forth.
I want to highlight, though, that, um if we think about ace inhibitor is an angiotensin receptor blockers and what they do to ace expression in, um, this raises a very interesting question.
