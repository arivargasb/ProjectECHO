1.  In those with prolonged symptoms, does that correlate with prolonged viral shedding and infectivity?

2.  Are patients reporting their Covid-19 tests are not being covered by Premera or BC/BS insurance vs Medicare if for travel and they have not had exposures or symptoms?

3.  did the increase in CV-19 relate to the increase in testing?

4.  If Covid19 is airborne, then we have to improve the ventilation in many/most places to created negative pressure. How is this being addressed?

5.  Based on what we know today, how relevant is to take the temperature of patients to enter a clinic?

6.  CDC says children less than 2 should not wear a mask; some pediatricians are advising children less than 5 should not wear a mask. How do we advise our clients?

7.  In relation to airborne issues, does UV light work?

8.  Should we be using more N-95 type masks and less surgical masks in the healthcare settings?

9.  Does the hospital have enough N-95?s for staff?

10.  COVID19 is transmitted via fomite, droplet and airborne, is it known which is the number one way people are getting it?

11.  Do you recommend that we continue to take the temperature of all the patients before they come into our clinic? Does this risk factor continue to be a recommended method to screen for Covid19?  

12.  Are you going to be more or less likely to develop your own antibodies if you get monoclonal antibodies?

13.  That is a really important question, Leslie.  If they have tested, isolated per CDC and are clear, it really complicates the decision tree if you get a second positive test.  Is that person still shedding infectious virus?  I donâ€™t even know how to work that up, short of viral cultures
