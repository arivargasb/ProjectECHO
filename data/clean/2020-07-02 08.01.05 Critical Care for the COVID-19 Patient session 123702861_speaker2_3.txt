So how does glycemia control impact survival invasions with diabetes?
And this was a recent report in the journal of Ah, cell metabolism that, um, it was a retrospective study of over 7000 COVID-19 patients and diabetes status again was associated with a higher risk of death.
But they took that further and looked at the impact of of blood sugar control and what they found.
This is in millimeter here, but that's the same 10 millimeter.
Is the same as 180 mg per deciliter, which is what we typically used to, ah, to measure glucose in the States.
And what they found is that for those with blood sugars, on average of less than 180 which we would consider well, controlled in this study that was considered well controlled.
Survival was was much better 98.9% whereas those with blood sugars greater than 180 on average.
These these hospitalized it's the risk of death was much higher.
Survival was only 89% said 11% death rate.
This is interesting.
It doesn't prove causeality because, uh, it could be that the blood sugars are high just because these air sicker patients with with COVID-19 or ah, another possibility is that the high blood sugars are increasing the risk of complications of COVID-19.
So we don't really know from this, but there's certainly a relationship there.
But again, there's.
There's some interest lately in other mechanisms playing a role in in, uh, the increased risk of complications were seeing in patients with diabetes.
And so why?
