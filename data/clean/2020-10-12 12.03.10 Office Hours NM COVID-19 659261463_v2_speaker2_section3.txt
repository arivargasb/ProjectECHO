I didn't necessarily think it was worth summarizing, but I thought they were worth either reading yourself or passing along to that difficult uncle on Facebook, COVID-19 myth busting by Robin.
I don't know how to pronounce it.
Schoenthaler I think she posts a lot on Facebook.
She's worth following on Facebook just for her post, but she wrote an article for Medium on the various myths around COVID, and this was quite good.
Um, UCSF had a grand rounds on October 6th.
Um, and they discuss President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and just sort of what it meant from a medical standpoint.
What you could tell what, um, what we know about the medications that were used to treat him.
It's veal on YouTube and then, um actually, um, the grand rounds has an hour and a half.
I didn't have time to watch it, but Julie Thompson MD is on Facebook, and she summarized it under her personal Facebook page.
She's from Oakland.
There's multiple Julie Thompson's, but, um, her summary was really excellent, and I think it's worth looking at if you're on Facebook and then Emily Auster's schools aren't super spreaders from the Atlantic.
I'm still waiting to see definitive medical articles on this, but this was quite a good summary.
And then Elizabeth Ralph here, how the pandemic finally ends was also an article that was definitely worth reading.
And that was everything I had.
