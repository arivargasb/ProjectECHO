But for sure, diabetes is associated with higher complications of COVID-19 infection, and this includes death.
And we talked about the relative increase in risk, whether your patient has type one versus type two diabetes and that it appears to be very age dependent in terms of the mechanism for increased risk in COVID-19 infected patients with diabetes, it's likely multi factorial.
We talked about a potential role for hyperglycemia, and we talked about a potential role for patterns of ace expression, leading to increased likelihood of inflammation thrombosis edema.
And among injury.
So, um, I think, uh, and here's some references.
And, uh, I think I'm happy or I know I'm happy to take any question.
