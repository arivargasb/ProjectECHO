Um, and that's why I was hoping for a doctor a Bouchonville to give us Ah, talk about diabetes.	8.5305
And And what is it about diabetes that is making this?	8.626333333333333
Um, such a risk factor for patients with COVID.	8.680833333333334
So with that point Doctor Bouchonville?	8.734333333333332
I would welcome you.	8.773166666666667
Thank you for presenting this morning.	8.7945
And, um, we're excited to learn from you.	8.823166666666667
My pleasure.	8.868333333333334
Thank you so much, Doctor Harkins what a case.	8.879166666666666
Um, I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen here so I can pull up my slides.	8.932333333333334
And, uh, let's see if your screen is like mine.	9.109
You have, ah thing on the right with all the people's faces, and you can kind of minimize that so you can see the whole screen.	9.188666666666668
Excuse me.	9.309
So, yeah, um, Dr Bouchonville.	9.327666666666666
I'm an endocrinologist I'm a diabetes specialist, and ah, I'm real excited to present.	9.358
Uh, this, uh, talk today is diabetes, a risk factor for COVID-19.	9.449333333333334
And let's see advancing slide here.	9.547333333333334
So no, no disclosures.	9.609333333333332
And hopefully, by the end of this talk, we'll be able to ah recognize that diabetes is a risk factor for complications of COVID-19 infection and we'll be able to understand some of the potential mechanisms for increased COVID-19 risk in patients with diabetes.	9.657333333333334
It's not fully fully understood, but there are a lot of, ah, a lot of possibilities that have been that have been studied, and we're gonna review that here.	9.908833333333332
So this is a, uh, I'm gonna start with this nice summary report, and there's if you have a copy of the slides.	10.079
The last slide is the reference is that you can find this this publication from the 88 that was just published this month and diabetes care, but it was a nice It's a nice summary of the early reports, mostly out of China, Um, about the risk of ah, of complications of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.	10.190499999999998
And so long story short is that thus far, there has not really been any evidence showing that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19.	10.509666666666668
So if you have diabetes, uh, your risk of getting COVID-19 doesn't appear to be any different than people without diabetes.	10.707333333333334
At least there hasn't been any strong data to suggest that yet.	10.853833333333334
But for people with diabetes who get COVID-19, there is a lot of their strong evidence that the risk for complications of COVID-19 is much higher.	10.907333333333334
So maybe not a higher risk of getting COVID-19, but definitely a higher risk of complications.	11.094
And based on early reports from China, it appears that Glycemic control might play a role in the severity of the illness.	11.190666666666667
And I'll share with you some.	11.332333333333334
Some data that supports that as well is some data to suggest that it's more complicated than that, that there might be other things that play responsible for the increased risk we're seeing in people with diabetes.	11.353166666666668
And so ah, again, this was really based on early reports from China.	11.564
If we look at that data from the United States, we can see that this there's definitely been a signal there as well.	11.639166666666666
This was a publication from the New England Journal of Medicine recently.	11.744166666666667
This was ah, case series in the Seattle region of critically ill patients with COVID-19, Um, just a small number of patients.	11.825333333333333
24 patients across nine Seattle area hospitals and average age was 64.	11.962833333333332
But what was really striking is that the most common coexisting disorder was diabetes.	12.068999999999999
Almost 60% of this of this cohort were patients with diabetes, and that's a much higher prevalence.	12.161666666666667
60% of Ah, well, of course, higher than the prevalence we see in the United States but also looking at K series of how prevalent is diabetes in the hospital setting.	12.283833333333332
This is much higher than that.	12.46
So it suggested that there's there's something to having diabetes where they're at higher risk of having having complications.	12.492333333333333
A larger series that was more recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine in May.	12.629
This was a preliminary report of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 um again larger series 1000 patients enrolled in this trial.	12.718166666666667
And here again, type two diabetes was very prevalent in that in that cohort, same with hypertension and obesity.	12.897333333333334
So kind of a metabolic syndrome profile for these patients who are more, uh, more ill, hospitalized with COVID-19 and then an even larger series published recently in JAMA.	13.0265
So this was almost 6000 patients.	13.226666666666667
These were people hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City and similar median age 63 years.	13.2605
But same kind of pattern hypertension, obesity, diabetes seem with high prevalence in this cohort.	13.386833333333334
So, again, this these data aren't necessarily showing that people diabetes are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19.	13.497333333333334
But it does suggest that people with diabetes who get COVID-19 are are they're representing, Ah, high prevalence of people in the hospital that are sicker with COVID-19.	13.635666666666667
So how can we Ah, how can we quantify the increased risk that we're seeing in patients with diabetes?	13.862333333333334
And there was a recently a preliminary report that came out of the UK This was, uh, looking at the national health system database.	13.955666666666668
So, uh, they have over 60 million individuals registered in that database.	14.127666666666666
And of that, 60 million 0.4% of those have type one, which is autoimmune diabetes, and almost 5% have type two diabetes with the one we associate with insulin resistance.	14.229000000000001
Like the case we just heard today and, um, of this data base, there were over 20,000 COVID-19 related deaths.	14.419666666666666
Um, interestingly, a third of those occurred in patients with diabetes.	14.579
Very alarming statistic there just by itself.	14.6545
If we look at the odds of of death from COVID-19 the odds ratio of mortality, you can say you can see that compared to patients without diabetes, the risk of dying was much higher, 3.5 times more likely to experience mortality related to COVID-19 in a patient with type one diabetes.	14.724
You know the risk was also increased in type two diabetes, with an odds ratio of two so two times more likely to die of COVID-19.	15.090666666666667
So this this report not only demonstrates that there's a higher risk of public or depth specifically in this in this study, but also that the risk might even be higher in patients with type one versus Type two diabetes.	15.224
So those with the auto immune diabetes, the risk appears to be almost double that of those with Type two diabetes.	15.471499999999999
And then again, both of them are at much higher risk compared to those without diabetes.	15.576166666666667
Interestingly, this was a very age dependent finding, So this is the same the same series here, and you could see the risk of mortality so the red line here represents Type one diabetes.	15.665666666666668
The blue line represents the cohort with Type two diabetes and then the black line.	15.870666666666667
It is the general population and kind of mirroring what we see in the general population, where the risk of mortality increases with age, especially once you get up into the 60 seventies and 80 plus but, um, higher with type one and type two diabetes, um, below the age of 40 or so it's ah, the risk of mortality is is much lower, even in those with diabetes so higher risk and those with diabetes of mortality and strongly age dependent.	15.945666666666666
All right, so I alluded to the impact of glycemia control earlier.	16.514
So how does glycemia control impact survival invasions with diabetes?	16.584166666666665
And this was a recent report in the journal of Ah, cell metabolism that, um, it was a retrospective study of over 7000 COVID-19 patients and diabetes status again was associated with a higher risk of death.	16.674
But they took that further and looked at the impact of of blood sugar control and what they found.	16.949166666666667
This is in millimeter here, but that's the same 10 millimeter.	17.057333333333336
Is the same as 180 mg per deciliter, which is what we typically used to, ah, to measure glucose in the States.	17.10533333333333
And what they found is that for those with blood sugars, on average of less than 180 which we would consider well, controlled in this study that was considered well controlled.	17.241333333333333
Survival was was much better 98.9% whereas those with blood sugars greater than 180 on average.	17.406166666666664
These these hospitalized it's the risk of death was much higher.	17.541333333333334
Survival was only 89% said 11% death rate.	17.6285
This is interesting.	17.699
It doesn't prove causeality because, uh, it could be that the blood sugars are high just because these air sicker patients with with COVID-19 or ah, another possibility is that the high blood sugars are increasing the risk of complications of COVID-19.	17.716
So we don't really know from this, but there's certainly a relationship there.	18.002666666666666
But again, there's.	18.079
There's some interest lately in other mechanisms playing a role in in, uh, the increased risk of complications were seeing in patients with diabetes.	18.090666666666667
And so why?	18.275666666666666
Why do people outside of hyperglycemia are there any other reasons why people with diabetes might have a higher complication rate those with COVID-19?	18.286833333333334
And so there's been a lot of interest lately in the, uh, potential role for the Renin Angiotensin system and ah, one thing we know, at least in mouse models of diabetes, so I mean, this could be the same case in humans where it's not completely known yet, but ACE expression.	18.459
So angiotensin converting enzyme, uh, is higher in the lungs of, ah, of mouse models of diabetes.	18.773000000000003
So it might be that that's the case in humans with diabetes as well, an activation of ace.	18.89966666666667
So A's expression eyes associated with inflammation.	19.014666666666667
It's associated with vasoconstriction.	19.084166666666665
That's why ace inhibitors does tend to lower BP but also associate with thrombosis, lung injury, fibrosis and edema.	19.113833333333332
All the things that kind of lead to to, uh what we see in COVID-19 is devastating complications of people with the infection.	19.250166666666665
So there might be higher a ACE expression in in the lungs of people with diabetes and ace2 might also play an important role in the in the disease process.	19.397333333333332
We know that ace2 is a target of ah cell entry, and I've got a schematic coming up, a figure that illustrates that.	19.569666666666667
And, uh, but ace2 might also play a role in, um, kind of moderating ace expression in people who have COVID-19 infection.	19.704
So ace2 is a counter regulatory, uh, enzyme that is kind of doing the opposite of everything.	19.889499999999998
That ace I just showed you was doing so decreased inflammation rather than increased inflammation.	20.007
And that's through suppression of TNF Alpha and some other mechanisms as well.	20.094
Anti fibrotic effects vasodilator addition rather than basal constriction.	20.19066666666667
And there's some evidence to suggest that ace2 might actually play a protective role in those with infection.	20.269000000000002
But the current thinking right now is that outcome might have a lot to do with the relative balance of Ace and ace2 so again, a stew being more protective even though.	20.387333333333334
It is a target for several entry, uh, playing a protective role in the setting of COVID-19 expression and again, playing more of, ah detrimental role for the reasons I just outlined and so, typically what happens whether a patient has diabetes or not.	20.596333333333334
Hopefully you can see my little mouse pointer here, my track pad.	20.884
So the virus binds with ace2 on the the epithelial cell of the, uh of the lung and is ah, this leads to cell entry, viral entry, replication and ace2 is actually down regulated so that your ace to ace2 ratio becomes less favorable aces is still there, but less ace2.	20.9495
So it kind of trips the balance and leads to an increased risk of lung injury.	21.342666666666666
Now in patients with diabetes.	21.44066666666667
If it's true that humans with diabetes just like the mouse model that they have increased ace expression in the lung, then this is kind of a double whammy picture.	21.463
They have an even worse ace2 ratio, leading to increased lung injury and so forth.	21.627833333333335
I want to highlight, though, that, um if we think about ace inhibitor is an angiotensin receptor blockers and what they do to ace expression in, um, this raises a very interesting question.	21.74233333333333
So does this potential mechanism for increased COVID-19 severity and those with diabetes.	21.919333333333334
Does this carry any therapeutic implications?	22.034499999999998
And I'm going to ah, highlight this recent study from Lancet where ah, they looked at the use of aces and RAAS, ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers and the risk of ah, admission or death from COVID-19.	22.089
This was a case population study, so they identified 1100 COVID positive cases requiring admission to the hospital, and then they matched COVID positive population controls that weren't hospitalized on a 1 to 10 ratio there.	22.380999999999997
And they looked at the impact of ACE inhibitors and ARBs versus other antihypertensive medications on hospital admission.	22.660666666666668
COVID-19 patients.	22.8055
And where they concluded, is that it appears that aces and RAAS because this has been a controversial question, right?	22.832333333333334
If ace2 is ah is a target for, ah, for cell entry for coronavirus.	22.925
Do we need to worry about ace inhibitors and ?	23.033
If they might, some studies suggest increase ace2 expression.	23.067166666666665
This is going to lead to more people having ah, uh, COVID-19 infections and so forth, but actually concluded that aces and RAAS appear to be safe.	23.130666666666666
They did not increase the risk of hospitalization.	23.272333333333332
Anyway, this study was not able to tell or answer the question of whether maybe milder infections are seeing with higher rates.	23.32316666666667
But at least, um, it didn't appear that aces and RAAS were increasing the risk for hospitalization, and this is included.	23.454166666666666
Fatal cases or those managed in the ICU.	23.566166666666668
But what was really interesting also very interesting is that they looked at potential interactions here.	23.618666666666666
So if you're not familiar, this is a forest plot.	23.728
We've got the line of unity here.	23.775666666666666
And then we have confidence intervals that are, as you can see here, typically crossing the line what you're looking for.	23.802
And when we're looking at interactions here, we're looking to see whether there was any differential effect of using aces and RAAS when you kind of broke down this cohort into different subgroups based on sex or they female or male, based on age, hypertension and so forth.	23.907
And then, you see, was there any difference in these confidence intervals between groups?	24.19066666666667
And if so, you would see a P value of less than 0.5 and actually the ones the one area where they did see a significant difference with the P value of 0.004 was the absence or presence of diabetes and very interesting here.	24.279
If you look at the confidence interval for people with diabetes versus those without, it actually falls to the left.	24.519833333333334
Completely off the line of unity, there was actually a protective effect in patients with diabetes who were on aces and RAAS they were about, and we can look at the odds ratio.	24.63083333333333
Here it's about 0.5, so they were about 50% as likely to be hospitalized or have a fatality or be managed in the ICU.	24.81116666666667
Uh, with COVID-19 compared to those without diabetes who were on ACEs or RAAS so very interesting that it just speaks to the potential relevance of the renin angiotensin system in patients with diabetes specifically because again, there didn't appear to be any impact in patients.	24.96066666666667
Uh, right in patients is a whole, so there might be something to that, um 1 last slide.	25.242166666666666
I wanted to just throw in for fun, cause this was It's actually not even published yet it, but it's in circulation.	25.375999999999998
It hasn't been peer reviewed yet, but also might shed some light on again, the mechanisms for worse outcomes in patients with diabetes who who have COVID-19 infection and, ah, some metformin.	25.48933333333333
This was an observational study of metformin and risk of mortality in people that were that were hospitalized with COVID-19, and these were people with obesity and with with diabetes.	25.7185
And we know that metformin reduces TNF Alpha, which, of course, plays a big role in inflammation so it could could play a role in cytokine storm and so forth, and we know that metformin suppresses TNF alpha, and it appears to be more, uh, a more prominent effect of metformin in women rather than men.	25.921499999999998
So this was a, ah, a retrospective analysis of claims data from over 6000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.	26.2615
The average age was 75 and they found that those on metformin who were women that mortality was actually decreased by over 20%.	26.37933333333333
So, uh, an interesting finding and definitely needs to be, uh, confirmed another with other studies.	26.5575
But, um, just to kind of summarize everything I've shared with you again, we don't have evidence yet to suggest that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19.	26.684
But for sure, diabetes is associated with higher complications of COVID-19 infection, and this includes death.	26.877833333333335
And we talked about the relative increase in risk, whether your patient has type one versus type two diabetes and that it appears to be very age dependent in terms of the mechanism for increased risk in COVID-19 infected patients with diabetes, it's likely multi factorial.	26.994000000000003
We talked about a potential role for hyperglycemia, and we talked about a potential role for patterns of ace expression, leading to increased likelihood of inflammation thrombosis edema.	27.271333333333335
And among injury.	27.462
So, um, I think, uh, and here's some references.	27.490666666666666
And, uh, I think I'm happy or I know I'm happy to take any question.	27.570666666666668
