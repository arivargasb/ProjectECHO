and try to build community.	0.0
So if you have a camera and can turn it on, please do that and leave it on.	0.01933333333333333
During the session, we would ask that you, uh, stay muted, um, and not not unmute yourself unless you're called one by one of the facilitators.	0.07433333333333333
And if you have any questions for the for, uh, doctor Harkins or her presenters, please put them into the chat box and we'll try to get to is many questions as we can today and we would ask that you not answer another.	0.23916666666666667
Don't answer the questions in the chat yourself.	0.4715
Unless you're one of the, uh, hub team members and a couple of other things.	0.52
We have a digital librarian who is putting a lot of really great information into the chat rooms.	0.608
And you can link on those directly and that information.	0.721
And lastly, if you want more information about what's going on project echo regarding COVID-19, things go to our website and you can find, um, recordings of previous sessions and and a lot of other information there.	0.8033333333333333
So with that, I will turn it over to Doctor Michelle Harkins to introduce yourself and, um, move forward Michelle.	1.0123333333333333
All right.	1.1601666666666666
Thanks, Doctor Thornton.	1.1668333333333334
Good morning and good morning before a holiday weekend.	1.183
So it's good to see some, uh, fases, even though maybe no one's going anywhere for the holiday.	1.2328333333333332
I know I'm not, but that's okay.	1.3128333333333333
So thanks for joining us this morning, and I I asked a colleague of mine to give a presentation today on, Ah, diabetes.	1.3451666666666666
And the reason, um, you know, the Wuhan data suggested that the patients that had the worst outcome were those with cardiovascular disease and, um, you know, age over, you know, 50 60 70 and I went up for decades.	1.4873333333333332
Um, but what we noticed in our cohort of patients, the majority of patients that did poorly were actually diabetics and in potential obese diabetic.	1.758
So my question was, you know, what is there?	1.9233333333333333
Is there something specific about diabetes that's putting these patients at risk and do?	1.9858333333333333
Is there something that we haven't really talked about or, um, with this in particular?	2.0566666666666666
So it's my pleasure to introduce.	2.133666666666667
Ah, my colleague, uh, met Bouchonville, who is an associate professor medicine.	2.1713333333333336
He's an associate director for project echoes.	2.277333333333333
So many of you may already know him, and he runs his own endocrine echo.	2.309833333333333
Um and so I'm going to present a case.	2.3713333333333333
Ah, patient that we, uh, got here and then I'll let Dr Bouchonville take over so we'll have our slides.	2.406
All right.	2.5756666666666663
Next slide.	2.5833333333333335
So this is a 46 year old woman who comes to the emergency department with dyspnea subjective fever chills and cough that really have been worsening over the last week on a review of systems her cough is dry.	2.6731666666666665
It's not productive.	2.864
She feels a little nausea, but has not had any emesis or abdominal pain no polyuria polydipsia.	2.884
She feels a little lightheaded when she stands up.	2.9883333333333337
Um, and this has all been happening over this week, and the symptoms have progressed during this week.	3.0251666666666663
Her brother also had a viral infection.	3.102
Um, and, uh, her past medical history is obesity, and she used to take medications metformin for diabetes a couple years ago, but then she just stopped and thinks that's really just diet control diabetes.	3.1505
But she also has not seen a primary care provider for over two years.	3.3741666666666665
She's not on any medications.	3.4415
And, of course, her family history is positive for diabetes and her father and her brother.	3.58333333333 
Next slide on the initial evaluation at the outside ah emergency department.	3.4723333333333333
Her room air saturation was 86%.	3.6670000000000003
She was tachycardic at 1 10 had a normal BP.	3.7093333333333334
22 was her respiratory rate.	3.7765
Her BMI was 34.	3.8253333333333335
In general, she appears very comfortable.	3.855166666666667
She's tachycrdic.	3.8913333333333333
She didn't have a murmur.	3.9069999999999996
Her chest was clear.	3.9231666666666665
Her abdomen was nontender.	3.941666666666667
She felt relatively well.	3.9765
Just the symptoms had been ramping up over the week.	4.022333333333333
So she decided to seek attention.	4.067833333333334
And she had no lesions on her, uh, skin exam.	4.096333333333333
Next slide.	4.160666666666667
The initial labs at the outside institution, of course.	4.2
Or COVID swab was positive.	4.2476666666666665
Her sodium was 1 26 chloride of 90 potassium of 3.0, and a bicarb of 15.	4.282333333333333
Her glucose was 400.	4.378333333333333
She hadn't anion gap of 21.	4.423333333333333
She had normal renal function.	4.470666666666667
Her troponin was negative and lactate was a little elevated at 3.4.	4.497166666666667
Her white count was normal and her chest actually had bilateral patch opacities next slide.	4.544333333333333
So she was given fluids and potassium and oxygen initially, and then she was transferred to our other facility.	4.707333333333334
It it's in one a Sandoval Regional Medical Center.	4.817666666666667
Excuse me for mild DKA in the setting of a COVID pneumonia when she actually arrived her bicarb normalized and her glucose was still elevated at 300.	4.872
But her gap had closed on.	5.080166666666667
Her gap was eight, but she still did have some key tones in her blood.	5.120166666666666
Insulin subq was started as a gap was closed and and she didn't have insulin started the outside hospital because her potassium was 3.0.	5.207333333333334
And they were a little worried that giving her insulin would shift more potassium in the cells and cause a bigger problem for her.	5.3325
So they concentrated on fluids, oxygen and potassium in the outside institution.	5.434
So she had the insulin subq started, Um, Ddimer.	5.513999999999999
On admission, it s R M.	5.586333333333333
C was 308 ldh was 295 a little elevated, and CRP was 11, or hemoglobin a1c was 11% and the estimated average glucose was 280 with that next slide.	5.617500000000001
So she was treated with oxygen sheet did self proning.	5.888999999999999
And she did really very well.	5.933833333333333
She was started on remdesivir and she ultimately was well controlled.	5.958333333333333
With on legal are Glargine 5 units at night and a sliding scale to control her blood sugar.	6.035833333333333
They were anticipating discharge.	6.126166666666666
She was on the floor service and then she spiked a fever and had worsening.	6.155833333333334
Ah, oxygen requirement On day six, she was intubated on day seven as she was requiring really high vent settings.	6.218999999999999
They did a CT scan that did not reveal a PE just had patchy bilateral infiltrates typical with COVID.	6.325333333333333
And then she was transferred to you in a hospital prior to proning attempts there at SRMC	6.476
Because she was tenuous and she thought, and providers wondered would she need ECMO.	6.577666666666667
Um, instead of just trying to keep things going at at the outside hospital next slide.	6.692333333333334
So when she was over here, she had regular, you know, typical vents setting.	6.835666666666667
She was on volume control.	6.925833333333333
We did targeted, you know, title volume, six cc's per kilo.	6.949166666666667
To try to decrease barrel trauma.	7.023833333333333
Um, she ramped up on those settings.	7.069
We we paralyzed her.	7.107333333333333
We've prone her.	7.14
She's on iNO, inhaled nitric oxide is a pulmonary basal dilator, um, to try to improve her oxygenation.	7.1545
She ultimately developed renal failure and is currently on ah, continuous renal replacement therapy.	7.277333333333333
Um, because she is on pressors now, due to some of the sedation, um, to maintain paralysis and proning, um and so wouldn't tolerate regular hemodialysis ultimately we changed her to the APRV or Bivent settings on hospital day 25.	7.384
Um, and this is just to try to improve her oxygenation.	7.725666666666667
She never required ECMO, um, and we were able to do things over the course of time, but she is actually still presently in the hospital, Um, and and very critically ill next slide.	7.789
So with that Ah, you know, this is a case of a, a patient with what she thought was diet controlled diabetes.	8.024
Otherwise, no real medical problems, Young woman, Um who then comes in and does pretty well and then in about a week into her course here at the hospital has was probably a cytokine-storm with the fever, little hypertension, worsening respiratory status, and now is still quite ill in our our system.	8.153333333333332
And so we've seen this several times.	8.480333333333332
Um, and that's why I was hoping for a doctor a Bouchonville to give us Ah, talk about diabetes.	8.5305
And And what is it about diabetes that is making this?	8.626333333333333
Um, such a risk factor for patients with COVID.	8.680833333333334
So with that point Doctor Bouchonville?	8.734333333333332
I would welcome you.	8.773166666666667
Thank you for presenting this morning.	8.7945
And, um, we're excited to learn from you.	8.823166666666667
My pleasure.	8.868333333333334
Thank you so much, Doctor Harkins what a case.	8.879166666666666
Um, I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen here so I can pull up my slides.	8.932333333333334
And, uh, let's see if your screen is like mine.	9.109
You have, ah thing on the right with all the people's faces, and you can kind of minimize that so you can see the whole screen.	9.188666666666668
Excuse me.	9.309
So, yeah, um, Dr Bouchonville.	9.327666666666666
I'm an endocrinologist I'm a diabetes specialist, and ah, I'm real excited to present.	9.358
Uh, this, uh, talk today is diabetes, a risk factor for COVID-19.	9.449333333333334
And let's see advancing slide here.	9.547333333333334
So no, no disclosures.	9.609333333333332
And hopefully, by the end of this talk, we'll be able to ah recognize that diabetes is a risk factor for complications of COVID-19 infection and we'll be able to understand some of the potential mechanisms for increased COVID-19 risk in patients with diabetes.	9.657333333333334
It's not fully fully understood, but there are a lot of, ah, a lot of possibilities that have been that have been studied, and we're gonna review that here.	9.908833333333332
So this is a, uh, I'm gonna start with this nice summary report, and there's if you have a copy of the slides.	10.079
The last slide is the reference is that you can find this this publication from the 88 that was just published this month and diabetes care, but it was a nice It's a nice summary of the early reports, mostly out of China, Um, about the risk of ah, of complications of COVID-19 and people with diabetes.	10.190499999999998
And so long story short is that thus far, there has not really been any evidence showing that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19.	10.509666666666668
So if you have diabetes, uh, your risk of getting COVID-19 doesn't appear to be any different than people without diabetes.	10.707333333333334
At least there hasn't been any strong data to suggest that yet.	10.853833333333334
But for people with diabetes who get COVID-19, there is a lot of their strong evidence that the risk for complications of COVID-19 is much higher.	10.907333333333334
So maybe not a higher risk of getting COVID-19, but definitely a higher risk of complications.	11.094
And based on early reports from China, it appears that Glycemic control might play a role in the severity of the illness.	11.190666666666667
And I'll share with you some.	11.332333333333334
Some data that supports that as well is some data to suggest that it's more complicated than that, that there might be other things that play responsible for the increased risk we're seeing in people with diabetes.	11.353166666666668
And so ah, again, this was really based on early reports from China.	11.564
If we look at that data from the United States, we can see that this there's definitely been a signal there as well.	11.639166666666666
This was a publication from the New England Journal of Medicine recently.	11.744166666666667
This was ah, case series in the Seattle region of critically ill patients with COVID-19, Um, just a small number of patients.	11.825333333333333
24 patients across nine Seattle area hospitals and average age was 64.	11.962833333333332
But what was really striking is that the most common coexisting disorder was diabetes.	12.068999999999999
Almost 60% of this of this cohort were patients with diabetes, and that's a much higher prevalence.	12.161666666666667
60% of Ah, well, of course, higher than the prevalence we see in the United States but also looking at K series of how prevalent is diabetes in the hospital setting.	12.283833333333332
This is much higher than that.	12.46
So it suggested that there's there's something to having diabetes where they're at higher risk of having having complications.	12.492333333333333
A larger series that was more recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine in May.	12.629
This was a preliminary report of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 um again larger series 1000 patients enrolled in this trial.	12.718166666666667
And here again, type two diabetes was very prevalent in that in that cohort, same with hypertension and obesity.	12.897333333333334
So kind of a metabolic syndrome profile for these patients who are more, uh, more ill, hospitalized with COVID-19 and then an even larger series published recently in JAMA.	13.0265
So this was almost 6000 patients.	13.226666666666667
These were people hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City and similar median age 63 years.	13.2605
But same kind of pattern hypertension, obesity, diabetes seem with high prevalence in this cohort.	13.386833333333334
So, again, this these data aren't necessarily showing that people diabetes are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19.	13.497333333333334
But it does suggest that people with diabetes who get COVID-19 are are they're representing, Ah, high prevalence of people in the hospital that are sicker with COVID-19.	13.635666666666667
So how can we Ah, how can we quantify the increased risk that we're seeing in patients with diabetes?	13.862333333333334
And there was a recently a preliminary report that came out of the UK This was, uh, looking at the national health system database.	13.955666666666668
So, uh, they have over 60 million individuals registered in that database.	14.127666666666666
And of that, 60 million 0.4% of those have type one, which is autoimmune diabetes, and almost 5% have type two diabetes with the one we associate with insulin resistance.	14.229000000000001
Like the case we just heard today and, um, of this data base, there were over 20,000 COVID-19 related deaths.	14.419666666666666
Um, interestingly, a third of those occurred in patients with diabetes.	14.579
Very alarming statistic there just by itself.	14.6545
If we look at the odds of of death from COVID-19 the odds ratio of mortality, you can say you can see that compared to patients without diabetes, the risk of dying was much higher, 3.5 times more likely to experience mortality related to COVID-19 in a patient with type one diabetes.	14.724
You know the risk was also increased in type two diabetes, with an odds ratio of two so two times more likely to die of COVID-19.	15.090666666666667
So this this report not only demonstrates that there's a higher risk of public or depth specifically in this in this study, but also that the risk might even be higher in patients with type one versus Type two diabetes.	15.224
So those with the auto immune diabetes, the risk appears to be almost double that of those with Type two diabetes.	15.471499999999999
And then again, both of them are at much higher risk compared to those without diabetes.	15.576166666666667
Interestingly, this was a very age dependent finding, So this is the same the same series here, and you could see the risk of mortality so the red line here represents Type one diabetes.	15.665666666666668
The blue line represents the cohort with Type two diabetes and then the black line.	15.870666666666667
It is the general population and kind of mirroring what we see in the general population, where the risk of mortality increases with age, especially once you get up into the 60 seventies and 80 plus but, um, higher with type one and type two diabetes, um, below the age of 40 or so it's ah, the risk of mortality is is much lower, even in those with diabetes so higher risk and those with diabetes of mortality and strongly age dependent.	15.945666666666666
All right, so I alluded to the impact of glycemia control earlier.	16.514
So how does glycemia control impact survival invasions with diabetes?	16.584166666666665
And this was a recent report in the journal of Ah, cell metabolism that, um, it was a retrospective study of over 7000 COVID-19 patients and diabetes status again was associated with a higher risk of death.	16.674
But they took that further and looked at the impact of of blood sugar control and what they found.	16.949166666666667
This is in millimeter here, but that's the same 10 millimeter.	17.057333333333336
Is the same as 180 mg per deciliter, which is what we typically used to, ah, to measure glucose in the States.	17.10533333333333
And what they found is that for those with blood sugars, on average of less than 180 which we would consider well, controlled in this study that was considered well controlled.	17.241333333333333
Survival was was much better 98.9% whereas those with blood sugars greater than 180 on average.	17.406166666666664
These these hospitalized it's the risk of death was much higher.	17.541333333333334
Survival was only 89% said 11% death rate.	17.6285
This is interesting.	17.699
It doesn't prove causeality because, uh, it could be that the blood sugars are high just because these air sicker patients with with COVID-19 or ah, another possibility is that the high blood sugars are increasing the risk of complications of COVID-19.	17.716
So we don't really know from this, but there's certainly a relationship there.	18.002666666666666
But again, there's.	18.079
There's some interest lately in other mechanisms playing a role in in, uh, the increased risk of complications were seeing in patients with diabetes.	18.090666666666667
And so why?	18.275666666666666
Why do people outside of hyperglycemia are there any other reasons why people with diabetes might have a higher complication rate those with COVID-19?	18.286833333333334
And so there's been a lot of interest lately in the, uh, potential role for the Renin Angiotensin system and ah, one thing we know, at least in mouse models of diabetes, so I mean, this could be the same case in humans where it's not completely known yet, but ACE expression.	18.459
So angiotensin converting enzyme, uh, is higher in the lungs of, ah, of mouse models of diabetes.	18.773000000000003
So it might be that that's the case in humans with diabetes as well, an activation of ace.	18.89966666666667
So A's expression eyes associated with inflammation.	19.014666666666667
It's associated with vasoconstriction.	19.084166666666665
That's why ace inhibitors does tend to lower BP but also associate with thrombosis, lung injury, fibrosis and edema.	19.113833333333332
All the things that kind of lead to to, uh what we see in COVID-19 is devastating complications of people with the infection.	19.250166666666665
So there might be higher a ACE expression in in the lungs of people with diabetes and ace2 might also play an important role in the in the disease process.	19.397333333333332
We know that ace2 is a target of ah cell entry, and I've got a schematic coming up, a figure that illustrates that.	19.569666666666667
And, uh, but ace2 might also play a role in, um, kind of moderating ace expression in people who have COVID-19 infection.	19.704
So ace2 is a counter regulatory, uh, enzyme that is kind of doing the opposite of everything.	19.889499999999998
That ace I just showed you was doing so decreased inflammation rather than increased inflammation.	20.007
And that's through suppression of TNF Alpha and some other mechanisms as well.	20.094
Anti fibrotic effects vasodilator addition rather than basal constriction.	20.19066666666667
And there's some evidence to suggest that ace2 might actually play a protective role in those with infection.	20.269000000000002
But the current thinking right now is that outcome might have a lot to do with the relative balance of Ace and ace2 so again, a stew being more protective even though.	20.387333333333334
It is a target for several entry, uh, playing a protective role in the setting of COVID-19 expression and again, playing more of, ah detrimental role for the reasons I just outlined and so, typically what happens whether a patient has diabetes or not.	20.596333333333334
Hopefully you can see my little mouse pointer here, my track pad.	20.884
So the virus binds with ace2 on the the epithelial cell of the, uh of the lung and is ah, this leads to cell entry, viral entry, replication and ace2 is actually down regulated so that your ace to ace2 ratio becomes less favorable aces is still there, but less ace2.	20.9495
So it kind of trips the balance and leads to an increased risk of lung injury.	21.342666666666666
Now in patients with diabetes.	21.44066666666667
If it's true that humans with diabetes just like the mouse model that they have increased ace expression in the lung, then this is kind of a double whammy picture.	21.463
They have an even worse ace2 ratio, leading to increased lung injury and so forth.	21.627833333333335
I want to highlight, though, that, um if we think about ace inhibitor is an angiotensin receptor blockers and what they do to ace expression in, um, this raises a very interesting question.	21.74233333333333
So does this potential mechanism for increased COVID-19 severity and those with diabetes.	21.919333333333334
Does this carry any therapeutic implications?	22.034499999999998
And I'm going to ah, highlight this recent study from Lancet where ah, they looked at the use of aces and RAAS, ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers and the risk of ah, admission or death from COVID-19.	22.089
This was a case population study, so they identified 1100 COVID positive cases requiring admission to the hospital, and then they matched COVID positive population controls that weren't hospitalized on a 1 to 10 ratio there.	22.380999999999997
And they looked at the impact of ACE inhibitors and ARBs versus other antihypertensive medications on hospital admission.	22.660666666666668
COVID-19 patients.	22.8055
And where they concluded, is that it appears that aces and RAAS because this has been a controversial question, right?	22.832333333333334
If ace2 is ah is a target for, ah, for cell entry for coronavirus.	22.925
Do we need to worry about ace inhibitors and ?	23.033
If they might, some studies suggest increase ace2 expression.	23.067166666666665
This is going to lead to more people having ah, uh, COVID-19 infections and so forth, but actually concluded that aces and RAAS appear to be safe.	23.130666666666666
They did not increase the risk of hospitalization.	23.272333333333332
Anyway, this study was not able to tell or answer the question of whether maybe milder infections are seeing with higher rates.	23.32316666666667
But at least, um, it didn't appear that aces and RAAS were increasing the risk for hospitalization, and this is included.	23.454166666666666
Fatal cases or those managed in the ICU.	23.566166666666668
But what was really interesting also very interesting is that they looked at potential interactions here.	23.618666666666666
So if you're not familiar, this is a forest plot.	23.728
We've got the line of unity here.	23.775666666666666
And then we have confidence intervals that are, as you can see here, typically crossing the line what you're looking for.	23.802
And when we're looking at interactions here, we're looking to see whether there was any differential effect of using aces and RAAS when you kind of broke down this cohort into different subgroups based on sex or they female or male, based on age, hypertension and so forth.	23.907
And then, you see, was there any difference in these confidence intervals between groups?	24.19066666666667
And if so, you would see a P value of less than 0.5 and actually the ones the one area where they did see a significant difference with the P value of 0.004 was the absence or presence of diabetes and very interesting here.	24.279
If you look at the confidence interval for people with diabetes versus those without, it actually falls to the left.	24.519833333333334
Completely off the line of unity, there was actually a protective effect in patients with diabetes who were on aces and RAAS they were about, and we can look at the odds ratio.	24.63083333333333
Here it's about 0.5, so they were about 50% as likely to be hospitalized or have a fatality or be managed in the ICU.	24.81116666666667
Uh, with COVID-19 compared to those without diabetes who were on ACEs or RAAS so very interesting that it just speaks to the potential relevance of the renin angiotensin system in patients with diabetes specifically because again, there didn't appear to be any impact in patients.	24.96066666666667
Uh, right in patients is a whole, so there might be something to that, um 1 last slide.	25.242166666666666
I wanted to just throw in for fun, cause this was It's actually not even published yet it, but it's in circulation.	25.375999999999998
It hasn't been peer reviewed yet, but also might shed some light on again, the mechanisms for worse outcomes in patients with diabetes who who have COVID-19 infection and, ah, some metformin.	25.48933333333333
This was an observational study of metformin and risk of mortality in people that were that were hospitalized with COVID-19, and these were people with obesity and with with diabetes.	25.7185
And we know that metformin reduces TNF Alpha, which, of course, plays a big role in inflammation so it could could play a role in cytokine storm and so forth, and we know that metformin suppresses TNF alpha, and it appears to be more, uh, a more prominent effect of metformin in women rather than men.	25.921499999999998
So this was a, ah, a retrospective analysis of claims data from over 6000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.	26.2615
The average age was 75 and they found that those on metformin who were women that mortality was actually decreased by over 20%.	26.37933333333333
So, uh, an interesting finding and definitely needs to be, uh, confirmed another with other studies.	26.5575
But, um, just to kind of summarize everything I've shared with you again, we don't have evidence yet to suggest that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19.	26.684
But for sure, diabetes is associated with higher complications of COVID-19 infection, and this includes death.	26.877833333333335
And we talked about the relative increase in risk, whether your patient has type one versus type two diabetes and that it appears to be very age dependent in terms of the mechanism for increased risk in COVID-19 infected patients with diabetes, it's likely multi factorial.	26.994000000000003
We talked about a potential role for hyperglycemia, and we talked about a potential role for patterns of ace expression, leading to increased likelihood of inflammation thrombosis edema.	27.271333333333335
And among injury.	27.462
So, um, I think, uh, and here's some references.	27.490666666666666
And, uh, I think I'm happy or I know I'm happy to take any question.	27.570666666666668
Didn't want to stop sharing my screen in here, so we can, uh, we'll see each other.	27.642333333333333
All right.	27.74233333333333
Thanks, Matt.	27.764
That was excellent.	27.775
Uh, kind of trying to help me put my head around.	27.793666666666663
Ah, diabetes.	27.845666666666666
And, you know, what are the issues that are?	27.869333333333334
But why is this woman that I presented getting well, I'm going to go home, And then now it's still, uh, you know, has a severe complication.	27.901
Um, and I don't know how many really present in DKA, but she had mild.	28.044
Ah, you gave that very quickly resolved with, uh, with fluids.	28.111333333333334
And maybe the COVID tipped her into DKA or, you know, a little little of each.	28.176499999999997
So was interesting.	28.259833333333333
But I let Doctor Thornton ask the questions and keep yourself things that that was a really, really excellent presentation.	28.28666666666667
A couple of questions in the chat one related to the case presentation.	28.416
Carlos in Alaska.	28.491666666666667
Oh, ask.	28.507166666666667
Do you think her risk was more increased due to obesity rather than diabetes?	28.516666666666666
That's a great question.	28.607333333333333
Um, and I'll let Matt add here too, because I was wondering because I've seen a few that have just had, um, obesity.	28.629166666666666
We have, Ah, a 33 year old, uh, obese gentlemen, 56 BMI.	28.744833333333336
On ECMO	28.831666666666667
Who didn't have diabetes, And we haven't had a 23 year old admitted that didn't have diabetes.	28.858999999999998
He was just a little portly.	28.963166666666666
Not much, but he you know, 23.	28.985833333333336
So I think the diabetes, um, is a risk factor for some, but I think obesity really adds into that.	29.026166666666665
I don't know Matt if you have any other, uh, comments on that.	29.136000000000003
Yeah, I agree with you, Michelle.	29.214
There There is a great question, too.	29.249333333333333
Um, there's definitely something there.	29.2905
There's a signal that people with obesity independent of diabetes are also at increased risk.	29.32283333333333
Um, how much of that is from the in people with diabetes The worst outcomes.	29.41783333333333
How much of that is from obesity versus the diabetes?	29.504666666666665
I don't I haven't seen any reports that are able to parse that out as a whole.	29.572166666666664
Those with Type one diabetes are leaner than those with Type two diabetes, but there's definitely still, at least in one series in the US, 30% of those with type one diabetes or still overweight or obese.	29.6445
But I bring that up because lots of lean people with diabetes are having that poor outcomes as well.	29.858999999999998
In fact, I showed you some data from the UK, where the Type one diabetes outcomes were even worse than those with Type two diabetes.	29.953500000000002
So, um, likely they're both increased risk factors.	30.080666666666666
Diabetes as independent of obesity as well.	30.151166666666665
I'm not sure about ACE expression and the lungs in those with obesity, but no diabetes.	30.223666666666666
That would be interesting to see, um, to see if there is a shared mechanism.	30.365666666666666
Potentially, Yeah, I think in an obese patients, all of the adipose sites, they're considered inflammatory.	30.442333333333334
You know, you have extra adipo kinds, and I believe you have more.	30.59333333333333
You know, you have, ah, a tricep tres in the adipose sites, I believe.	30.665666666666667
And so if you've got more of those, you have more ace receptors.	30.724
So maybe there's ah pathway there.	30.762666666666668
And I think there's also a concern on the obese patient that comes into the ICU, you know, trying to oxygenate them if they have a lot of abdominal obesity, it can also cause a little compression or inability to expand.	30.8
Um, the, you know, just regular breathing.	31.055666666666664
And so we may have issues with them trying to trying to oxygenate.	31.108333333333334
Um, it may be a little bit more difficult than it's extra work for them if they have, Ah, obese chest, um, or abdominal contents, that kind of rise up.	31.196
But I think there's Ah, yeah, the the obese patient has, uh, is considered have increased inflammation, Which may be why they're also, you know, MIs OCA, uh, they're at risk for, uh, PEE.	31.350166666666667
You know, there are a variety of things that just obesity in and of itself can do.	31.577333333333335
And I think there's more ace expression potentially.	31.642333333333333
So separating out.	31.689666666666668
The diabetes and the obese question are are difficult, but we do see it.	31.719
Uh, here was just obesity is as the risk factor for poor outcome.	31.794
Thank you, Michelle.	31.902333333333335
Matt, can you talk about a little bit more?	31.918
About ace inhibitors.	31.944000000000003
And the question was, Do ACE inhibitors lower ACE1 or ACE2, or both?	31.960166666666666
All right.	32.06066666666667
Thank you.	32.0685
Yeah, it's, um so they are are going to counter ace expression.	32.077333333333335
And so that, at least in patients with diabetes, might be what is improving or was shown to improve in this one, series I shared with you, uh, outcomes in those with diabetes who also had COVID-19.	32.183166666666665
The impact on ace2, um is not quite is clear.	32.43266666666667
There's some mixed mixed findings on that, but most of the the evidence I've seen suggests that they're actually increasing ace two expression, Which is why early on, there was some concern about what our ace inhibitors actually increasing risk COVID-19 infection.	32.51883333333333
Well, in theory, if you're increasing ace2 expression, there are gonna be more targets for COVID-19.	32.782333333333334
But actually that that increased ace two expression, um, in the setting of blocking ace expression, um, if anything in patients with diabetes, it's actually improving outcomes.	32.894
But again, we can't.	33.119166666666665
These studies don't prove causality, but at least in those foot diabetes, that was the association as a whole.	33.157333333333334
There was no impact on disease severity, but again, it was really the subset of those with diabetes where it appeared that faces and arms might actually be protective.	33.27433333333333
Thank you Matt Carlos Nolasco.	33.444
I'm up for you and I meet yourself and actually act.	33.48983333333334
Ask your question your next question.	33.533166666666666
Just just It's a very interesting and relevant question.	33.568666666666665
Sure, yes.	33.62566666666667
So I was so taking a health and economic disparities out of the discussion just because, you know that plays a role in in a there's a clinical outcomes.	33.63916666666667
I wanted to ask if there's any data suggested that Hispanics or being of Hispanic race made, um, it may be associated with a higher risk of hospitalization where it comes due to the increased risk for metabolic syndrome or the risk of diabetes that we know that Hispanics have.	33.81933333333333
Thank you.	34.150666666666666
Carlos.	34.15566666666667
Can you just also introduce yourself where you're from?	34.16133333333333
Yes.	34.208999999999996
So Hello.	34.217
Sorry, I'm doses ambitious here on, uh, I'm from El Salvador I'm a practice internist here and, um uh, in Springfield, Illinois, I'm doing private practice right now.	34.249
But, you know, for five years, I was, uh I could have an internist at Southern Illinois University, and it used to be part of Project echo pipe professional with the university, Uh, from 17 to 2019.	34.45133333333333
And you know, right now I'm trying to figure out if, you know we can, uh we can hope in a project echo on COVID-19 for Salvadoran physicians too.	34.669
Excellent.	34.82733333333333
Thank you so much.	34.839166666666664
My pleasure.	34.86016666666667
All right.	34.900999999999996
Thank you.	34.90933333333333
That's an excellent question.	34.916000000000004
How?	34.94166666666667
Carlos?	34.945
A nice, nice to meet you stated in the United States, there's certainly evidence suggesting ethnic disparities.	34.95333333333333
Um, in terms of complications and death rates related to COVID-19.	35.06766666666667
Ah, most familiar with that data with respect to black Americans.	35.146166666666666
Um, I not positive, but, I mean, I could make a guess that yes, maybe we're seeing the same thing in Hispanic Americans.	35.229
Um, but I haven't review that closely, but any group where there is, ah, higher prevalence of obesity in diabetes again, we don't have strong evidence that they're higher risk of getting COVID-19.	35.38066666666667
But certainly the risk of complications appears to be higher.	35.585166666666666
Yeah, I would say the majority of our patients admitted to the UNM hospital or even our center ball regional.	35.67066666666666
Uh, medical center had been, um, you know, Native American Ah, or Alaska native with, Ah, a lot of have diabetes, obesity and all those things.	35.77016666666667
So, you know, that's the majority of the patients that are admitted to our institution.	35.963499999999996
But that also is, You know, we're right neighboring to the Navajo Nation, and we have several Pueblo tribes here in New Mexico.	36.04266666666667
So we're seeing a A large proportion of our patients are native Americans and and the other obviously we're in a majority minority state.	36.158833333333334
And so we have a lot of Hispanic patients as well.	36.29983333333333
And that seemed to be the predominant ones that are admitted to the hospital, or at least in the ICU from from my standpoint.	36.34166666666667
So it would make sense.	36.4605
Thank you, Michelle.	36.477999999999994
So that is the the last question in the chat.	36.52383333333333
We would love to hear how anybody has any questions related to this, or I think anything else.	36.5955
Michelle, You You'd be happy to hear them.	36.683166666666665
So, um, and the other bus, Michelle Ormat, Um, I just kind of getting back to the case.	36.724000000000004
I don't know, uh, Michelle, whether it's been protocol here for critically ill patients to receive dexamethasone, given some recent data, But just another thing that another consideration in patients with diabetes because of the balance between the dexamethasone and the higher blood sugars.	36.916000000000004
So often, if If that's the case, it's recommended to treat patients with an insulin drip.	37.222
But I wonder how this patient is doing from a glassy make standpoint now.	37.313833333333335
Um, well, so this patient was given dexamethasone later.	37.3805
Um, especially when the the recovery trial was published, suggesting less, Um Ah, mortality.	37.43566666666666
If you were on a ventilator getting dexamethasone, so then yes, was put on an insulin drip because you really have to kind of watch how how Ah, there by seem in control.	37.5895
Um is impacted when you're putting people on steroids.	37.74366666666666
And I think because of that trial, whether that the trial has the most sound data, Um, and the randomization skin was a little off, but, um, you know, people are using it.	37.82383333333333
And so that's another thing that you need to really be kind of on pop up toe controller.	37.99883333333333
My stomach issues.	38.06766666666667
We've had two or three other patients, um, the inner ICU and Matt, maybe you can help me with us to it that have had extreme hyperglycemia just randomly and, you know, that's that is reported that with COVID, you may have issues with hyperglycemia.	38.103833333333334
Um, and all of a sudden, you know, for no reason they didn't get steroids.	38.39533333333333
All of a sudden, they're on an insulin.	38.45766666666667
Drip it eight or 10 units an hour, and then in a 24 hour period, it just seemed to resolve.	38.477
And we didn't have a reason for that, per se.	38.56066666666666
And I don't know what mechanism there.	38.60933333333333
Maybe for that.	38.658166666666666
And maybe it was just someone was giving them something we didn't know.	38.67933333333334
But I doubt that in the ICU is really interesting.	38.74283333333334
Yeah, and these were people with pre existing diabetes, but some labile blood, sugars and the right just everything was fine.	38.82
And then one day they just spiked up.	38.92616666666667
And that's maybe part of the storm, uh, having more hyperglycemia.	38.96366666666667
You know, just all the metabolic disturbance is, um, so it was surprising, but ah, you know, that a fever and it was more difficult to control their blood sugar and then, you know, more aggressive insulin drip, and then we're able to bring things down on.	39.044333333333334
Now they're back.	39.29066666666667
Tow normal state just was interesting.	39.30083333333334
Yeah, that would be That would add a major challenge to treating these patients, at least anecdotally, you know, Stanford University runs the nation wide diabetes and the time of COVID echo on Wednesday mornings, and I've heard them describe patients would just very labile from our our glycemia control.	39.37716666666667
That's presumably related to just what you mentioned.	39.71366666666667
The show changes in cytokine-storm levels and inflammation such that it could be really risky to treat those patients with subcutaneous insulin because their insulin needs can change from our two hours.	39.752833333333335
So again, just speaking to the, uh, importance of considering IV insulin in the ICU setting, Yeah, thank you, patients, Thank you very much.	39.9465
There's a couple other questions that came up in the chat Captain.	40.11516666666667
Tourists ask to These patients need to see endocrinology and cardiology outpatient once they were discharged.	40.157333333333334
Uh huh.	40.27016666666667
After Captain, I don't know.	40.288000000000004
If you want to meet yourself.	40.30433333333334
Maybe Are you asking about patients in general or just patients?	40.32083333333333
You already have diagnosis diabetes.	40.36816666666667
Um, now I have received my first patient that survived.	40.40233333333333
I'm ah, a medical director at Saint Michaels Clinic, which is a non profit clinic.	40.49216666666667
That's it's within the Navajo Nation that's not associated with age s.	40.59883333333333
And so I probably what I want to do is present him in one of your Echo's because it Really?	40.6865
He did survive.	40.804833333333335
He lost 50 lbs.	40.824666666666666
He was ventilated, his hemoglobin a one c was quite high, and he was obese, and he's lost the weight.	40.86416666666666
But now he, you know, was just charged a few weeks ago, and I've been following him, and he's starting to put his weight back on.	40.975833333333334
And then, you know, I'm trying to get him to cardiology, But it really there's no evidence now that how those of us out in primary care now that they've survived, how do we want?	41.10483333333333
Keep them healthy?	41.31933333333333
And what things do we need to do for them?	41.339666666666666
So one of for me is that do I need to just Consul in a chronology, cause he was able to go just to just stay on the oral hypoglycemic so, And he got off his insulin.	41.376333333333335
So if I can keep him with his hemoglobin a one c below seven.	41.5935
Um, it will be nice, but kind of what are the things I need to be looking for?	41.6785
So, um, and it's impressive to see him.	41.748000000000005
He's he's, like, so full of joy, you know?	41.801500000000004
I mean, he really was gonna walk out of that hospital and, um, he was fortunate enough to be to be able to go to rehab after his experience.	41.85966666666666
So they were really able to get him to walk and do all those things, and it's a joy to see him.	42.020833333333336
But I want to make sure we're following him correctly and for me, because I just doesn't have any outpatient facilities open.	42.10466666666667
I'm going to start seeing some of those people as they transition out.	42.256499999999996
But there's really no follow up, like, What do I need to be doing to make sure you know?	42.335
So I'll be glad to present him, Um, which started started.	42.43116666666666
I'll talk to you about that this later this week, but just kind of your thoughts.	42.50333333333333
I kind of want to hear what everybody thinks about that.	42.58766666666667
They have a question, Uh, from an endocrine standpoint.	42.650333333333336
Um, yeah, I think it's the things to watch for with somebody who's experienced 50 lbs of weight loss.	42.721333333333334
I think we're gonna be hypoglycemia.	42.81633333333333
I'm sure his if he was on insulin before his requirements are probably much lower now.	42.84916666666666
And I think, uh, you you bring up really important question because with people with diabetes representing such a large segment of the critical care population.	42.94566666666666
We're gonna be seeing this more more.	43.122
Um, in New Mexico, at the university, even New Mexico.	43.151666666666664
I mean, we're always happy to help with the diabetes control, but travel right now is is tricky with COVID-19.	43.24533333333333
And I think that Ah, what you brought up presenting this patient on the network is a great idea.	43.37683333333334
I'm gonna put our digital library in on the spot here and request that he put in the chat box if he hasn't already a link to our endo echo on Wednesdays and then also the diabetes and the time of COVID Echo, which is also free to join the national Stanford Echo, which is also on Wednesdays.	43.46666666666667
So you can you can click on that and register.	43.76316666666666
Um, does that answer your question, Catherine?	43.815000000000005
No, no, thank you.	43.87566666666667
Yeah, because I think it's something we, you know, really have Thio.	43.897166666666664
I'm glad that we're going to start looking at it together because it's amazing to do really the hard work everyone has done in and how fast all of you, in critical care of really pinpoint what's really going on.	43.967
And but now they're surviving And what it?	44.21516666666666
So now how to make sure we we continue the keep him in good health.	44.27316666666666
So I appreciate that.	44.34616666666667
Thank you.	44.36583333333333
Sure.	44.38316666666666
Oh, go ahead.	44.404833333333336
Michigan.	44.412166666666664
Just say that's been a a topic that's come up is ah, request potentially.	44.425
You know what?	44.50016666666667
What do we do with the survivors or who survives?	44.50983333333333
And what do we look for?	44.55016666666667
And are Ah, Alicia, Parana does our COVID fallout clinic.	44.58416666666667
And I see some of my study patients in that clinic a za follow up once they've gotten out of their act to study.	44.656333333333336
Um and you know what?	44.774166666666666
What things do we need to look for?	44.814
So that that's a good topic to kind of put together in a in a nutshell for for folks now that patients are surviving him back into their community.	44.832166666666666
Um what What?	44.95433333333334
Things are important to follow up.	44.97116666666667
So that's a good topic that we can address Cinna in a few weeks, you know?	45.0
Well, and thank you.	45.07383333333333
Because not all of them are at you.	45.089166666666664
And now, so, as you know, they've been flown all over, and then they just get sent back.	45.13783333333333
And so, um and, um has done a good job about making sure there's follow up.	45.223333333333336
So for those patients, it's nice to hear that that you're here and available for that.	45.30166666666666
Thank you.	45.37966666666667
Great.	45.40316666666667
Thank you so much.	45.4075
Katherine.	45.41683333333334
Know this is something else.	45.428
Yeah.	45.466166666666666
Yeah.	45.47666666666667
And I know this isn't your question, Catherine, but just a nice general tips for people in the network right now is that, uh, we're seeing increased use in ah, recent years of SGLT two inhibitors because of emerging evidence that they're cardio and renal protective.	45.480333333333334
And so we're thinking about that class of medications in older patients with heart disease especially.	45.73316666666666
And this is a group of patients at increased risk for COVID.	45.810500000000005
That class of medications is associated with an increased risk of DKA.	45.858666666666664
So most people are recommending holding in your ALC patients if with diabetes, if if they do, um, contract COVID-19 considering stopping or holding the SGLT two inhibitor until they've recovered to help lessen the risk of DKA.	45.9425
Thank you, Matt.	46.25966666666667
There was another question.	46.28066666666667
Um, about well, the association between ace's to and the outcomes of COVID-19 support getting non diabetic patients with COVID-19 ace inhibitors.	46.3125
Great.	46.503
Thank you.	46.51016666666667
And, um, right now, the recommendation because there's evidence in people, including those with diabetes, that aces and arms don't increase the risk of complications.	46.5195
They're didn't really appear to be, ah, protective effect overall either.	46.688
So the recommendation is to just continue aces and arms for right now.	46.765
In the absence of a Contra indication, I've not seen any suggestion for putting patients on an ace or an ARB in the absence of hypertension or diabetes and again the nose with diabetes that appear that they had a protective effect in terms of hospitalization and mortality.	46.844833333333334
But there is no recommendation right now to put people on diabetes on an ace or an ARB and the absence of albumin, urea or hypertension.	47.11483333333333
And there is, Ah, trial, that is, um, you know, because a lot of things we don't know the answer to and so really the the weight Oh, find an answer is, is with a clinical trial and and ah, kind of a rigorous way of doing things.	47.25966666666667
And so we are potentially going to start the Remicade trial here, which is giving on ACE inhibitor for treatment of COVID and in probably the nonhospitalized patient to see just that worsen Or does that help prevent, um Ah, the, uh, admission rate.	47.46366666666667
And so, um, that's one of things that we're kind of looking at now is s.	47.763333333333335
So it's giving an ace inhibitor for to treat COVID.	47.8275
Um and it's the Ramot trial, and it's on Ah, clinical trials that, uh, go but way haven't signed up yet.	47.882666666666665
But that's one of things we're working through that process to get that trial going here.	48.02316666666666
Thank you so much, Michel.	48.0995
I just want to tell everybody another potassium.	48.12416666666666
The Lakers just was coming to the China couple of minutes ago.	48.158
And if we would love to get your feedback and, um, hear about things that things like this that are coming up that you would like for us to present on, And if you'd like to present a case, please let us know about as well.	48.20516666666666
Also, wanna think else even eat asparagus.	48.406166666666664
Who's working with us here?	48.442
Project excellence and Latin American echoes Spanish speaking, and they're just getting started.	48.46133333333333
And for, um, I think for Carlos, if you're interested, please contact us that for anyone else to Spanish speaking, there are, um, again letting a Latin American COVID-19 echoes is Spanish now on, But they were in supine o'clock mountain time.	48.559999999999995
Thank you.	48.80783333333333
If you're welcome.	48.8305
So let's There's no other questions.	48.85783333333333
Michelle.	48.90716666666666
I don't know if you want Thio.	48.917500000000004
Um you want us a turnabout?	48.943999999999996
Yeah.	49.02583333333334
So, again, Thanks so much, Matt.	49.032666666666664
That was really, um, excellent and kind of the pathophysiology and and, ah, with ace inhibitors and diabetes And knowing that these patients are at a risk of extreme complications, even though you think they have very mild disease, it is possible.	49.0585
So, um, I do appreciate your time this morning and talking with us.	49.327999999999996
Thank you so much.	49.40133333333333
I don't think you will appreciate the opportunity.	49.42016666666667
And so, for the next sessions, um, we have next week, Dr Alina Zamora will be presenting on mechanical ventilation and timing of intubation tricks and other airway management.	49.48116666666667
We may, uh, model Thea see long helmets for CPAP.	49.695166666666665
Um, and you know the questions that come up about that over the course of time.	49.76483333333333
We're just going to where we are now with our you know, when do we intimate?	49.85816666666666
When do we trade?	49.92616666666667
Are there other specific event manipulations or other things that we can try to help the patients.	49.948499999999996
Um, from our months of experience now and then we will also be having a, uh, hopefully a pediatric update on a pediatric disease and the multi ah, inflammatory system disease that they have.	50.05916666666667
Um and then potentially an update on ah, coagulation parameters, platelet therapy and other things.	50.2975
Ah, with our, um, our database here and, you know, are we doing the right thing and pulling the data and following up with what other institutions were doing?	50.40566666666667
So those are kind of the next topics up on the docket.	50.56266666666667
But I do also, you know, I've had some folks won't ask about the recovery phase, and I think that that would be an important topic just as the patients come back into your community.	50.61216666666667
Ah, these patients have had some have had severe ARDS on a tray gone event for weeks.	50.783833333333334
So you know, what does that look like?	50.9035
Um, and how is that gonna go back into your community and and how you're gonna take care of these patients?	50.93766666666667
And they also may have PTSD.	51.0475
They may have.	51.0765
You know, other things from their long ICU stay and sedation and, uh, issues and critical illness polyneuropathy from all of the medications.	51.08866666666667
So a lot of things that we can talk about in the future.	51.24283333333334
So all right, well, there's no other questions.	51.316
Thank you so much.	51.379333333333335
And a happy, happy fourth.	51.39233333333333
Um, And I hope you enjoy your your weekends, and, uh, we'll look forward to seeing you next week.	51.43
It's everyone.	51.56266666666667
Bye bye.	51.58183333333333
So, yeah, I think the follow up is a I mean, it's such a It's a great idea.	53.44583333333333
I don't know that there's a lot to say.	53.543
People don't really know.	53.57983333333333
I send that our data about, you know, ARDS survivors in general ARDS COVID survivors that I think there are racial disparities in that as well.	53.596000000000004
And, um, I think, ah, you know, it's just gonna be We don't know a lot right now, but, I mean, there are some things coming out about what What these folks are up against.	53.75916666666667
Yeah, and maybe maybe we can find it.	53.9675
I don't know how it gets to your revealing the health disparities issues.	53.9995
Just I mean, it's more more data is becoming available, but I don't know.	54.04716666666666
Yeah, we should think about that.	54.123333333333335
Yeah.	54.159
Should that be put as like a potential topic been for August?	54.20399999999999
The six just agree.	54.27583333333334
I don't think about a team a shot on a who?	54.345666666666666
All right, Who's the right person that?	54.40266666666666
Yeah, I know of anybody, but yeah, I mean, I know, uh, not a leash.	54.43116666666666
I thought about asking Alecia parotid just to talk about her clinic that see the follow up clinic and what they're looking at and what they're seeing and telling patients.	54.58533333333333
But, you know, she could be like a person just to present that little bit of, you know, that she's really the right person to talk about, Um, the disparities.	54.724000000000004
Let me think about it.	54.872499999999995
Yeah, maybe it's making.	54.89516666666667
It's a separate HIV in separate topic of that.	54.91616666666666
Yeah, but I'll think about it, too, cause I and I've been reading some of the literature, But just to see if there's somebody even nationally that might be interested in just giving every presentation, I'll think about it, too.	54.958999999999996
There was ah, on our, um, division director for, um, Gabe.	55.1365
Is it Copeland?	55.23116666666667
I'll have to think what his last name is, but and he might run from Hopkins, but he was just talking about racial disparities, you know, We're just talking about the whole, um, aspect of what's going on in the world now and then.	55.245
All the racial disparities and medicine, period.	55.4225
And, you know, on then, you know, a little section on ah, what has been seen so far.	55.46333333333334
So I'll try to find his slides, but he was a good, pretty good speaker.	55.5525
So, anyway, um, maybe four should be out of, you know, captain tourists, Carla, um, over Michelle DNA, Your name, But she was going to email you.	55.62533333333333
So I was like, Oh, I think she meant ever You are.	55.81916666666667
Should go.	55.873666666666665
Maybe she'll email on the COVID.	55.8865
Okay, Yeah, I'll keep an eye out for that and stuff.	55.924
And then if so, then maybe she would want to present a case for the post COVID recovery one.	55.972
Yeah, if she's able to be the speakers.	56.05216666666667
Well, okay.	56.13633333333333
Great.	56.169999999999995

Oh, okay.	56.45033333333333
Um, yes.	56.48166666666667
I'm like an interesting I think there it was.	56.4965
A little lower attendance, and I thought it was gonna be, But then it may be because of the holiday So, um, we'll see over the next couple weeks and see how that goes.	56.52616666666667
Um, I felt like I wonder how much critical care is going to creep out of just critical care now that the multi specialty one is gone.	56.7015
Um, I feel like the those two topics or a little bit going, but, you know, if that's and if there's the need and stuff, so sounds good.	56.853833333333334
Um, and any feedback on your so I can't hear you leave, everything's fine.	57.00716666666666

So I was like, Go, go, go.	57.6645
Yeah, no problem.	57.73383333333334
But anything on your side, any chest or anything on the I t side that went on know everything was smooth.	57.7705
Well, that's how we like it And tweak anything.	57.89383333333333
No, nothing for me.	57.98633333333333
I'm just hearing back up.	58.013333333333335
And anytime I don't have to back up is a good sign.	58.0325
Um, I do want to mention record.	58.10516666666667

I am.	59.93983333333333
So I was so afraid that he's gonna start making noise like, Oh, please don't know because he's still loud.	59.944833333333335
He's It's like those husky videos that you see.	60.036833333333334
Um, if you don't pay attention to them, it just really weird sounds that come out of him.	60.093666666666664
Yeah, I heard that rescues could be a little meaty, and he's not any more of the Husky.	60.227833333333336
He's I don't even know what he is.	60.30533333333334
He's a month of some sort, but he's just so vocal.	60.3335
