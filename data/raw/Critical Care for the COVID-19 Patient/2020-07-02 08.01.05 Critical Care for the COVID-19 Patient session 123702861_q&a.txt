Do you think her risk was more increased due to obesity rather than diabetes?	28.516666666666666
That's a great question.	28.607333333333333
Um, and I'll let Matt add here too, because I was wondering because I've seen a few that have just had, um, obesity.	28.629166666666666
We have, Ah, a 33 year old, uh, obese gentlemen, 56 BMI.	28.744833333333336
On ECMO	28.831666666666667
Who didn't have diabetes, And we haven't had a 23 year old admitted that didn't have diabetes.	28.858999999999998
He was just a little portly.	28.963166666666666
Not much, but he you know, 23.	28.985833333333336
So I think the diabetes, um, is a risk factor for some, but I think obesity really adds into that.	29.026166666666665
I don't know Matt if you have any other, uh, comments on that.	29.136000000000003
Yeah, I agree with you, Michelle.	29.214
There There is a great question, too.	29.249333333333333
Um, there's definitely something there.	29.2905
There's a signal that people with obesity independent of diabetes are also at increased risk.	29.32283333333333
Um, how much of that is from the in people with diabetes The worst outcomes.	29.41783333333333
How much of that is from obesity versus the diabetes?	29.504666666666665
I don't I haven't seen any reports that are able to parse that out as a whole.	29.572166666666664
Those with Type one diabetes are leaner than those with Type two diabetes, but there's definitely still, at least in one series in the US, 30% of those with type one diabetes or still overweight or obese.	29.6445
But I bring that up because lots of lean people with diabetes are having that poor outcomes as well.	29.858999999999998
In fact, I showed you some data from the UK, where the Type one diabetes outcomes were even worse than those with Type two diabetes.	29.953500000000002
So, um, likely they're both increased risk factors.	30.080666666666666
Diabetes as independent of obesity as well.	30.151166666666665
I'm not sure about ACE expression and the lungs in those with obesity, but no diabetes.	30.223666666666666
That would be interesting to see, um, to see if there is a shared mechanism.	30.365666666666666
Potentially, Yeah, I think in an obese patients, all of the adipose sites, they're considered inflammatory.	30.442333333333334
You know, you have extra adipo kinds, and I believe you have more.	30.59333333333333
You know, you have, ah, a tricep tres in the adipose sites, I believe.	30.665666666666667
And so if you've got more of those, you have more ace receptors.	30.724
So maybe there's ah pathway there.	30.762666666666668
And I think there's also a concern on the obese patient that comes into the ICU, you know, trying to oxygenate them if they have a lot of abdominal obesity, it can also cause a little compression or inability to expand.	30.8
Um, the, you know, just regular breathing.	31.055666666666664
And so we may have issues with them trying to trying to oxygenate.	31.108333333333334
Um, it may be a little bit more difficult than it's extra work for them if they have, Ah, obese chest, um, or abdominal contents, that kind of rise up.	31.196
But I think there's Ah, yeah, the the obese patient has, uh, is considered have increased inflammation, Which may be why they're also, you know, MIs OCA, uh, they're at risk for, uh, PEE.	31.350166666666667
You know, there are a variety of things that just obesity in and of itself can do.	31.577333333333335
And I think there's more ace expression potentially.	31.642333333333333
So separating out.	31.689666666666668
The diabetes and the obese question are are difficult, but we do see it.	31.719
Uh, here was just obesity is as the risk factor for poor outcome.	31.794
Thank you, Michelle.	31.902333333333335
Matt, can you talk about a little bit more?	31.918
About ace inhibitors.	31.944000000000003
And the question was, Do ACE inhibitors lower ACE1 or ACE2, or both?	31.960166666666666
All right.	32.06066666666667
Thank you.	32.0685
Yeah, it's, um so they are are going to counter ace expression.	32.077333333333335
And so that, at least in patients with diabetes, might be what is improving or was shown to improve in this one, series I shared with you, uh, outcomes in those with diabetes who also had COVID-19.	32.183166666666665
The impact on ace2, um is not quite is clear.	32.43266666666667
There's some mixed mixed findings on that, but most of the the evidence I've seen suggests that they're actually increasing ace two expression, Which is why early on, there was some concern about what our ace inhibitors actually increasing risk COVID-19 infection.	32.51883333333333
Well, in theory, if you're increasing ace2 expression, there are gonna be more targets for COVID-19.	32.782333333333334
But actually that that increased ace two expression, um, in the setting of blocking ace expression, um, if anything in patients with diabetes, it's actually improving outcomes.	32.894
But again, we can't.	33.119166666666665
These studies don't prove causality, but at least in those foot diabetes, that was the association as a whole.	33.157333333333334
There was no impact on disease severity, but again, it was really the subset of those with diabetes where it appeared that faces and arms might actually be protective.	33.27433333333333
Thank you Matt Carlos Nolasco.	33.444
I'm up for you and I meet yourself and actually act.	33.48983333333334
Ask your question your next question.	33.533166666666666
Just just It's a very interesting and relevant question.	33.568666666666665
Sure, yes.	33.62566666666667
So I was so taking a health and economic disparities out of the discussion just because, you know that plays a role in in a there's a clinical outcomes.	33.63916666666667
I wanted to ask if there's any data suggested that Hispanics or being of Hispanic race made, um, it may be associated with a higher risk of hospitalization where it comes due to the increased risk for metabolic syndrome or the risk of diabetes that we know that Hispanics have.	33.81933333333333
Thank you.	34.150666666666666
Carlos.	34.15566666666667
Can you just also introduce yourself where you're from?	34.16133333333333
Yes.	34.208999999999996
So Hello.	34.217
Sorry, I'm doses ambitious here on, uh, I'm from El Salvador I'm a practice internist here and, um uh, in Springfield, Illinois, I'm doing private practice right now.	34.249
But, you know, for five years, I was, uh I could have an internist at Southern Illinois University, and it used to be part of Project echo pipe professional with the university, Uh, from 17 to 2019.	34.45133333333333
And you know, right now I'm trying to figure out if, you know we can, uh we can hope in a project echo on COVID-19 for Salvadoran physicians too.	34.669
Excellent.	34.82733333333333
Thank you so much.	34.839166666666664
My pleasure.	34.86016666666667
All right.	34.900999999999996
Thank you.	34.90933333333333
That's an excellent question.	34.916000000000004
How?	34.94166666666667
Carlos?	34.945
A nice, nice to meet you stated in the United States, there's certainly evidence suggesting ethnic disparities.	34.95333333333333
Um, in terms of complications and death rates related to COVID-19.	35.06766666666667
Ah, most familiar with that data with respect to black Americans.	35.146166666666666
Um, I not positive, but, I mean, I could make a guess that yes, maybe we're seeing the same thing in Hispanic Americans.	35.229
Um, but I haven't review that closely, but any group where there is, ah, higher prevalence of obesity in diabetes again, we don't have strong evidence that they're higher risk of getting COVID-19.	35.38066666666667
But certainly the risk of complications appears to be higher.	35.585166666666666
Yeah, I would say the majority of our patients admitted to the UNM hospital or even our center ball regional.	35.67066666666666
Uh, medical center had been, um, you know, Native American Ah, or Alaska native with, Ah, a lot of have diabetes, obesity and all those things.	35.77016666666667
So, you know, that's the majority of the patients that are admitted to our institution.	35.963499999999996
But that also is, You know, we're right neighboring to the Navajo Nation, and we have several Pueblo tribes here in New Mexico.	36.04266666666667
So we're seeing a A large proportion of our patients are native Americans and and the other obviously we're in a majority minority state.	36.158833333333334
And so we have a lot of Hispanic patients as well.	36.29983333333333
And that seemed to be the predominant ones that are admitted to the hospital, or at least in the ICU from from my standpoint.	36.34166666666667
So it would make sense.	36.4605
Thank you, Michelle.	36.477999999999994
So that is the the last question in the chat.	36.52383333333333
We would love to hear how anybody has any questions related to this, or I think anything else.	36.5955
Michelle, You You'd be happy to hear them.	36.683166666666665
So, um, and the other bus, Michelle Ormat, Um, I just kind of getting back to the case.	36.724000000000004
I don't know, uh, Michelle, whether it's been protocol here for critically ill patients to receive dexamethasone, given some recent data, But just another thing that another consideration in patients with diabetes because of the balance between the dexamethasone and the higher blood sugars.	36.916000000000004
So often, if If that's the case, it's recommended to treat patients with an insulin drip.	37.222
But I wonder how this patient is doing from a glassy make standpoint now.	37.313833333333335
Um, well, so this patient was given dexamethasone later.	37.3805
Um, especially when the the recovery trial was published, suggesting less, Um Ah, mortality.	37.43566666666666
If you were on a ventilator getting dexamethasone, so then yes, was put on an insulin drip because you really have to kind of watch how how Ah, there by seem in control.	37.5895
Um is impacted when you're putting people on steroids.	37.74366666666666
And I think because of that trial, whether that the trial has the most sound data, Um, and the randomization skin was a little off, but, um, you know, people are using it.	37.82383333333333
And so that's another thing that you need to really be kind of on pop up toe controller.	37.99883333333333
My stomach issues.	38.06766666666667
We've had two or three other patients, um, the inner ICU and Matt, maybe you can help me with us to it that have had extreme hyperglycemia just randomly and, you know, that's that is reported that with COVID, you may have issues with hyperglycemia.	38.103833333333334
Um, and all of a sudden, you know, for no reason they didn't get steroids.	38.39533333333333
All of a sudden, they're on an insulin.	38.45766666666667
Drip it eight or 10 units an hour, and then in a 24 hour period, it just seemed to resolve.	38.477
And we didn't have a reason for that, per se.	38.56066666666666
And I don't know what mechanism there.	38.60933333333333
Maybe for that.	38.658166666666666
And maybe it was just someone was giving them something we didn't know.	38.67933333333334
But I doubt that in the ICU is really interesting.	38.74283333333334
Yeah, and these were people with pre existing diabetes, but some labile blood, sugars and the right just everything was fine.	38.82
And then one day they just spiked up.	38.92616666666667
And that's maybe part of the storm, uh, having more hyperglycemia.	38.96366666666667
You know, just all the metabolic disturbance is, um, so it was surprising, but ah, you know, that a fever and it was more difficult to control their blood sugar and then, you know, more aggressive insulin drip, and then we're able to bring things down on.	39.044333333333334
Now they're back.	39.29066666666667
Tow normal state just was interesting.	39.30083333333334
Yeah, that would be That would add a major challenge to treating these patients, at least anecdotally, you know, Stanford University runs the nation wide diabetes and the time of COVID echo on Wednesday mornings, and I've heard them describe patients would just very labile from our our glycemia control.	39.37716666666667
That's presumably related to just what you mentioned.	39.71366666666667
The show changes in cytokine-storm levels and inflammation such that it could be really risky to treat those patients with subcutaneous insulin because their insulin needs can change from our two hours.	39.752833333333335
So again, just speaking to the, uh, importance of considering IV insulin in the ICU setting, Yeah, thank you, patients, Thank you very much.	39.9465
There's a couple other questions that came up in the chat Captain.	40.11516666666667
Tourists ask to These patients need to see endocrinology and cardiology outpatient once they were discharged.	40.157333333333334
Uh huh.	40.27016666666667
After Captain, I don't know.	40.288000000000004
If you want to meet yourself.	40.30433333333334
Maybe Are you asking about patients in general or just patients?	40.32083333333333
You already have diagnosis diabetes.	40.36816666666667
Um, now I have received my first patient that survived.	40.40233333333333
I'm ah, a medical director at Saint Michaels Clinic, which is a non profit clinic.	40.49216666666667
That's it's within the Navajo Nation that's not associated with age s.	40.59883333333333
And so I probably what I want to do is present him in one of your Echo's because it Really?	40.6865
He did survive.	40.804833333333335
He lost 50 lbs.	40.824666666666666
He was ventilated, his hemoglobin a one c was quite high, and he was obese, and he's lost the weight.	40.86416666666666
But now he, you know, was just charged a few weeks ago, and I've been following him, and he's starting to put his weight back on.	40.975833333333334
And then, you know, I'm trying to get him to cardiology, But it really there's no evidence now that how those of us out in primary care now that they've survived, how do we want?	41.10483333333333
Keep them healthy?	41.31933333333333
And what things do we need to do for them?	41.339666666666666
So one of for me is that do I need to just Consul in a chronology, cause he was able to go just to just stay on the oral hypoglycemic so, And he got off his insulin.	41.376333333333335
So if I can keep him with his hemoglobin a one c below seven.	41.5935
Um, it will be nice, but kind of what are the things I need to be looking for?	41.6785
So, um, and it's impressive to see him.	41.748000000000005
He's he's, like, so full of joy, you know?	41.801500000000004
I mean, he really was gonna walk out of that hospital and, um, he was fortunate enough to be to be able to go to rehab after his experience.	41.85966666666666
So they were really able to get him to walk and do all those things, and it's a joy to see him.	42.020833333333336
But I want to make sure we're following him correctly and for me, because I just doesn't have any outpatient facilities open.	42.10466666666667
I'm going to start seeing some of those people as they transition out.	42.256499999999996
But there's really no follow up, like, What do I need to be doing to make sure you know?	42.335
So I'll be glad to present him, Um, which started started.	42.43116666666666
I'll talk to you about that this later this week, but just kind of your thoughts.	42.50333333333333
I kind of want to hear what everybody thinks about that.	42.58766666666667
They have a question, Uh, from an endocrine standpoint.	42.650333333333336
Um, yeah, I think it's the things to watch for with somebody who's experienced 50 lbs of weight loss.	42.721333333333334
I think we're gonna be hypoglycemia.	42.81633333333333
I'm sure his if he was on insulin before his requirements are probably much lower now.	42.84916666666666
And I think, uh, you you bring up really important question because with people with diabetes representing such a large segment of the critical care population.	42.94566666666666
We're gonna be seeing this more more.	43.122
Um, in New Mexico, at the university, even New Mexico.	43.151666666666664
I mean, we're always happy to help with the diabetes control, but travel right now is is tricky with COVID-19.	43.24533333333333
And I think that Ah, what you brought up presenting this patient on the network is a great idea.	43.37683333333334
I'm gonna put our digital library in on the spot here and request that he put in the chat box if he hasn't already a link to our endo echo on Wednesdays and then also the diabetes and the time of COVID Echo, which is also free to join the national Stanford Echo, which is also on Wednesdays.	43.46666666666667
So you can you can click on that and register.	43.76316666666666
Um, does that answer your question, Catherine?	43.815000000000005
No, no, thank you.	43.87566666666667
Yeah, because I think it's something we, you know, really have Thio.	43.897166666666664
I'm glad that we're going to start looking at it together because it's amazing to do really the hard work everyone has done in and how fast all of you, in critical care of really pinpoint what's really going on.	43.967
And but now they're surviving And what it?	44.21516666666666
So now how to make sure we we continue the keep him in good health.	44.27316666666666
So I appreciate that.	44.34616666666667
Thank you.	44.36583333333333
Sure.	44.38316666666666
Oh, go ahead.	44.404833333333336
Michigan.	44.412166666666664
Just say that's been a a topic that's come up is ah, request potentially.	44.425
You know what?	44.50016666666667
What do we do with the survivors or who survives?	44.50983333333333
And what do we look for?	44.55016666666667
And are Ah, Alicia, Parana does our COVID fallout clinic.	44.58416666666667
And I see some of my study patients in that clinic a za follow up once they've gotten out of their act to study.	44.656333333333336
Um and you know what?	44.774166666666666
What things do we need to look for?	44.814
So that that's a good topic to kind of put together in a in a nutshell for for folks now that patients are surviving him back into their community.	44.832166666666666
Um what What?	44.95433333333334
Things are important to follow up.	44.97116666666667
So that's a good topic that we can address Cinna in a few weeks, you know?	45.0
Well, and thank you.	45.07383333333333
Because not all of them are at you.	45.089166666666664
And now, so, as you know, they've been flown all over, and then they just get sent back.	45.13783333333333
And so, um and, um has done a good job about making sure there's follow up.	45.223333333333336
So for those patients, it's nice to hear that that you're here and available for that.	45.30166666666666
Thank you.	45.37966666666667
Great.	45.40316666666667
Thank you so much.	45.4075
Katherine.	45.41683333333334
Know this is something else.	45.428
Yeah.	45.466166666666666
Yeah.	45.47666666666667
And I know this isn't your question, Catherine, but just a nice general tips for people in the network right now is that, uh, we're seeing increased use in ah, recent years of SGLT two inhibitors because of emerging evidence that they're cardio and renal protective.	45.480333333333334
And so we're thinking about that class of medications in older patients with heart disease especially.	45.73316666666666
And this is a group of patients at increased risk for COVID.	45.810500000000005
That class of medications is associated with an increased risk of DKA.	45.858666666666664
So most people are recommending holding in your ALC patients if with diabetes, if if they do, um, contract COVID-19 considering stopping or holding the SGLT two inhibitor until they've recovered to help lessen the risk of DKA.	45.9425
Thank you, Matt.	46.25966666666667
There was another question.	46.28066666666667
Um, about well, the association between ace's to and the outcomes of COVID-19 support getting non diabetic patients with COVID-19 ace inhibitors.	46.3125
Great.	46.503
Thank you.	46.51016666666667
And, um, right now, the recommendation because there's evidence in people, including those with diabetes, that aces and arms don't increase the risk of complications.	46.5195
They're didn't really appear to be, ah, protective effect overall either.	46.688
So the recommendation is to just continue aces and arms for right now.	46.765
In the absence of a Contra indication, I've not seen any suggestion for putting patients on an ace or an ARB in the absence of hypertension or diabetes and again the nose with diabetes that appear that they had a protective effect in terms of hospitalization and mortality.	46.844833333333334
But there is no recommendation right now to put people on diabetes on an ace or an ARB and the absence of albumin, urea or hypertension.	47.11483333333333
And there is, Ah, trial, that is, um, you know, because a lot of things we don't know the answer to and so really the the weight Oh, find an answer is, is with a clinical trial and and ah, kind of a rigorous way of doing things.	47.25966666666667
And so we are potentially going to start the Remicade trial here, which is giving on ACE inhibitor for treatment of COVID and in probably the nonhospitalized patient to see just that worsen Or does that help prevent, um Ah, the, uh, admission rate.	47.46366666666667

So, again, Thanks so much, Matt.	49.032666666666664
That was really, um, excellent and kind of the pathophysiology and and, ah, with ace inhibitors and diabetes And knowing that these patients are at a risk of extreme complications, even though you think they have very mild disease, it is possible.	49.0585
So, um, I do appreciate your time this morning and talking with us.	49.327999999999996
Thank you so much.	49.40133333333333

And so, for the next sessions, um, we have next week, Dr Alina Zamora will be presenting on mechanical ventilation and timing of intubation tricks and other airway management.	49.48116666666667
We may, uh, model Thea see long helmets for CPAP.	49.695166666666665
Um, and you know the questions that come up about that over the course of time.	49.76483333333333
We're just going to where we are now with our you know, when do we intimate?	49.85816666666666
When do we trade?	49.92616666666667
Are there other specific event manipulations or other things that we can try to help the patients.	49.948499999999996
Um, from our months of experience now and then we will also be having a, uh, hopefully a pediatric update on a pediatric disease and the multi ah, inflammatory system disease that they have.	50.05916666666667
Um and then potentially an update on ah, coagulation parameters, platelet therapy and other things.	50.2975
Ah, with our, um, our database here and, you know, are we doing the right thing and pulling the data and following up with what other institutions were doing?	50.40566666666667
So those are kind of the next topics up on the docket.	50.56266666666667
But I do also, you know, I've had some folks won't ask about the recovery phase, and I think that that would be an important topic just as the patients come back into your community.	50.61216666666667
Ah, these patients have had some have had severe ARDS on a tray gone event for weeks.	50.783833333333334
So you know, what does that look like?	50.9035
Um, and how is that gonna go back into your community and and how you're gonna take care of these patients?	50.93766666666667
And they also may have PTSD.	51.0475
They may have.	51.0765
You know, other things from their long ICU stay and sedation and, uh, issues and critical illness polyneuropathy from all of the medications.	51.08866666666667
So a lot of things that we can talk about in the future.	51.24283333333334
So all right, well, there's no other questions.	51.316
Thank you so much.	51.379333333333335

Bye bye.	51.58183333333333
So, yeah, I think the follow up is a I mean, it's such a It's a great idea.	53.44583333333333
I don't know that there's a lot to say.	53.543
People don't really know.	53.57983333333333
I send that our data about, you know, ARDS survivors in general ARDS COVID survivors that I think there are racial disparities in that as well.	53.596000000000004
And, um, I think, ah, you know, it's just gonna be We don't know a lot right now, but, I mean, there are some things coming out about what What these folks are up against.	53.75916666666667
Yeah, and maybe maybe we can find it.	53.9675
I don't know how it gets to your revealing the health disparities issues.	53.9995
Just I mean, it's more more data is becoming available, but I don't know.	54.04716666666666
Yeah, we should think about that.	54.123333333333335
Yeah.	54.159
Should that be put as like a potential topic been for August?	54.20399999999999
The six just agree.	54.27583333333334
I don't think about a team a shot on a who?	54.345666666666666
All right, Who's the right person that?	54.40266666666666
Yeah, I know of anybody, but yeah, I mean, I know, uh, not a leash.	54.43116666666666
I thought about asking Alecia parotid just to talk about her clinic that see the follow up clinic and what they're looking at and what they're seeing and telling patients.	54.58533333333333
But, you know, she could be like a person just to present that little bit of, you know, that she's really the right person to talk about, Um, the disparities.	54.724000000000004
Let me think about it.	54.872499999999995
Yeah, maybe it's making.	54.89516666666667
It's a separate HIV in separate topic of that.	54.91616666666666
Yeah, but I'll think about it, too, cause I and I've been reading some of the literature, But just to see if there's somebody even nationally that might be interested in just giving every presentation, I'll think about it, too.	54.958999999999996
There was ah, on our, um, division director for, um, Gabe.	55.1365
Is it Copeland?	55.23116666666667
I'll have to think what his last name is, but and he might run from Hopkins, but he was just talking about racial disparities, you know, We're just talking about the whole, um, aspect of what's going on in the world now and then.	55.245
All the racial disparities and medicine, period.	55.4225
And, you know, on then, you know, a little section on ah, what has been seen so far.	55.46333333333334
So I'll try to find his slides, but he was a good, pretty good speaker.	55.5525
So, anyway, um, maybe four should be out of, you know, captain tourists, Carla, um, over Michelle DNA, Your name, But she was going to email you.	55.62533333333333
So I was like, Oh, I think she meant ever You are.	55.81916666666667
Should go.	55.873666666666665
Maybe she'll email on the COVID.	55.8865
Okay, Yeah, I'll keep an eye out for that and stuff.	55.924
And then if so, then maybe she would want to present a case for the post COVID recovery one.	55.972
Yeah, if she's able to be the speakers.	56.05216666666667

A little lower attendance, and I thought it was gonna be, But then it may be because of the holiday So, um, we'll see over the next couple weeks and see how that goes.	56.52616666666667
Um, I felt like I wonder how much critical care is going to creep out of just critical care now that the multi specialty one is gone.	56.7015
Um, I feel like the those two topics or a little bit going, but, you know, if that's and if there's the need and stuff, so sounds good.	56.853833333333334
