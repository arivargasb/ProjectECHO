thing like I did last week.	0.0
So it's going to be pretty, pretty, mostly clinical and epidemiological.	0.05516666666666667
We have a lot of things to cover, but these are some of the main publication.	0.1255
So the first thing was the data published in The New England Journal about the Moderna vaccine in older patients that, you know influenza and other vaccines are not as influenza vaccines and other vaccines are usually not as effective in older groups, so it's important to take a look at how the new vaccines that we are developing against COVID-19 work in older folks.	0.189
This publication by Moderna was was welcomed.	0.5885
They actually look at the data for patients 56 70 and also over 71.	0.653
And they were testing the two doses in their two protocols, the 25 microgram and a 100 microgram.	0.7845
And I can tell you right right off the bat that they're gonna use probably the old the higher dose for elderly patients.	0.8856666666666667
So the 100 microgram dose and we're going to show some of the results today.	1.0233333333333332
This is the basically the protocol.	1.1066666666666667
They have four groups.	1.1625
10 in each group, 10 patients in the group.	1.1855
This is an early early story, 20 in that group of 56 to 70 and 20 in the more than than 71.	1.2168333333333334
And they were pretty balanced regarding gender and ethnicity.	1.3395000000000001
But mostly, mostly, were actually whites are not too many minorities represented in this study, which is an issue with some of these vaccine trials.	1.4171666666666667
The adverse event.	1.5773333333333333
It's something that we're used to see.	1.6098333333333334
The first vaccination, which is the column on the left, doesn't produce that much in the way of adverse events.	1.6411666666666667
Some local expected local discomfort, but the second dose is definitely much more reactive.	1.7561666666666667
Janick and this is across the board, younger and older people.	1.8558333333333332
But it's it's also present in the elderly, so it's important.	1.9071666666666667
And I think all of the bad things that we have seen are associated with significant react allergenicity, which is bad for the patient.	1.963
But it's good if you take it in into the if you interpret these as an immunological reaction to the vaccine, so it's not an inert material.	2.0875
It's actually something that you get some low grade fever, fatigue, soreness in the area of injection, but Hopefully, this will correlate with immune response and talking about immune response that one of the most important markers are the neutralizing antibodies.	2.2188333333333334
And this.	2.528
We have the 2 25 doses in the 50 to 70 more than 71 the 100 mg, and you can see that the basically the levels of neutralizing antibody, especially the high dose the 100 mg, produces the same levels of antibody as younger patient.	2.5348333333333333
This is the column of 18 to 55 from the previous published study, so you can see that the levels of antibodies and the neutralizing antibodies was very similar when you use the 100 microgram in in any age, essentially 56 to 70 and 71.	2.847666666666667
So that was good news that this vaccine seems to be immunogenic even in in older in older patients.	3.1225
You send these FRNT, which is one of the assays when you use with the real virus PRNT you can see there's a slight decrease in the neutralizing antibody between the younger group 56 to 70 and more than 71 but still pretty decent levels which are comparable with with what we've seen in the younger population.	3.2445
So So that's That's the good news about these Moderna vaccine that it seems to be immunogenic for elderly folks.	3.5925000000000002
And the same thing happens with the T-cell response, the cellular immunity.	3.706166666666667
Definitely the low dose didn't mount almost any response.	3.7736666666666663
This is the T CD4 Th1 response.	3.8421666666666665
But you can see that there's an important cell mediated immunity response in the higher dose for both Group 56 to 70 and more than 71 so that these results are the one that indicate that we're going to probably use the high dose or or the high goes where we use Moderna, especially for early patients.	3.898
And no, no, Th2 two, which is the the the one that we don't want the type of response that may be associated with pulmonary inflammation.	4.262333333333333
It's basically not present with any of the doses in any of the age group, so that was also good news.	4.421333333333333
And and there was one publication on hydroxychloroquine.	4.541666666666667
I think the only the only area that is still somewhat debatable on hydroxychloroquine is we can use it as pre-exposure prophylaxis.	4.604333333333333
As you know it's been discarded as a treatment for moderate, mild and severe COVID.	4.764333333333334
But there's still some some investigator, which think that if you use it early enough, you may have an effect.	4.867500000000001
But these are double-blind placebo randomized study of hydroxychloroquine in actually healthcare workers.	4.981333333333334
They were taking these hydroxychloroquine before they they were exposed to COVID.	5.111166666666667
And when they look at those who were taking and not taking the hydroxychloroquine, no difference.	5.2105
It's another another negative study for for hydroxychloroquine, in this case as pre-exposure prophylaxis, and we have already post-prophylaxis and a side step treatment.	5.2885
So hydroxychloroquine so far, no, no good news from from that, An article that was actually pushed at the beginning of the of the pandemic assess a possible treatment based on the in vitro study in Vero cells.	5.461833333333333
But there's definitely no no clinical efficacy in this clinical trial.	5.713833333333333
Another, another topic that we have been discussing is the long COVID, and I found this recent paper published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection.	5.863833333333333
It's actually a pretty well known study on follow up of patient with no critical COVID because, as you know, there has been the discussion that some of this long COVID symptoms are may be related to the fact that the patient is in ICU, intubated, inmobile.	6.031333333333333
So they when they leave the hospital, they're weak, that they still have some long issues.
They have a lot of fatigue, and people have a speculated that that this may be partly just due to the, you know, the the critical face of the disease.	6.352833333333334
So this author's actually look at the non-critical COVID patients, and they follow them for 60 days.	6.491166666666667
And they did, like, standardized questionnaires on these patients and register the symptomatology.	6.595666666666667
And they actually initially enroll 293 patients.	6.705
They ended up because some patients were not known included 101 with mild to moderate COVID and 29 with severe COVID.	6.805000000000001
But non-critical, not ICU COVID, And the results, what we suspected that a high, very high percentage of patient on day 30 and a 60 almost almost two third of the patients, they have persistent symptoms.	6.934666666666667
So more than one or more symptoms in basically two third and this persisted all the way out to the 60 day follow up.	7.223166666666667
So it's a pretty, you know, prevalent issue.	7.367666666666667
Some of the most frequent symptoms was the loss of sense off smell and taste.	7.450666666666667
The anosmia and ageusia we have at the onset 59% hearted on day 30 28 they 60 still, like one quarter of the patient, have these these anosmia, or loss of taste.	7.531833333333334
Also astenia, which was not reported in the initial information with 50% in day 30 and 40% on day 60.	7.7935
And dyspnea, you can see the 36% on day 30 and 30%.	7.9845
So so a lot of these symptoms seems to persist beyond day 30 and on all the way to two months after they left the hospital.	8.085833333333333
The other interesting finding on this trial was to to see if there were factors associated with symptoms persistence, and they found first the younger age group, a relatively younger age group 40 to 60 were more likely to have this symptoms if the patient was hospitalized, obviously, and if there were, there was evidence of a normal pulmonary auscultation, which are all markers or severe disease.	8.183166666666667
So the more severe disease the higher the likelihood and the issue was kind of interesting.	8.575666666666667
It was not the older or the younger, but actually like like the middle of the of the group, 
And this is this is sort of the same result put graphically, so to the right is the odds-ratio of having persistent symptoms.	8.656333333333333
So if you receive oxygen, if you have a normal auscultation if you're hospitalized, which is essentially, in my view, the same thing you had a higher odds-ratio of having symptoms.	8.868166666666667
And if you were in this age from 40 to 60 also was to the right of the curve.	9.054
So a higher probability of having symptoms.	9.134500000000001
So, you know, this is more information regarding the lung COVID which I found interesting.	9.1895
This this was age 30 age 60 very similar results.	9.276166666666667
The other important trial that was published over the last week was the final report of the Remdesivir.	9.375666666666666
And I'm gonna I'm not going to go over the you know, all over the graph and things that the result of this final report was very similar to the original bigger publication, the preliminary report.	9.493166666666667
So the end of the story is that that Remdesivir shorten the recovery patients received Remdesivir across the board and this tudy had 10 days.	9.6805
They recover as supposed to 15 days of the placebo arms.	9.832833333333333
So five day reduction in the recovery, which gives you a rate of recovery of 30% more, 1.29 basically, these are the confidence intervals and this was a statistically significant.	9.900666666666666
Unfortunately, the mortality the Kaplan-Meier mortality report A day 15 and 8 29 there wasn't America.	10.103666666666667
We better survival with Remdesivir 6.7 versus 11.9 a day, 15 11.4 versus 15 in the placebo warm.	10.252833333333333
But both of these differences were know statistically significant.	10.402166666666666
So because the house or racial cross one barely course one.	10.487
So I mean, but But you can see that definitely the mortality was less in the Remdesivir, but it was not statistically significant.	10.562166666666666
This was a pretty large trial of thousands, you know, more than 1000 patients or so that was the final report of Remdesivir.	10.706
You know, a positive finding, but not know what we expect that especially no impact in mortality, at least in this trial.	10.844166666666666
And again, patients with that were receiving oxygen, but not in ECMO or mechanical ventilation, where those who benefit the most was the larger group and was also the group that received more benefit, those who were at the beginning of the disease or not required oxygen, no significant changes.	10.951666666666666
And and those at the end of the spectrum also had less of an impact.	11.253166666666667
So so the drug should be used presumably early, but in post patient that require oxygen.	11.318333333333333
That was that sort of the conclusion of the of the final report.	11.399166666666668
And I'm not.	11.471166666666667
I'm not going to go into this so I'm going to skip the graph for the sake of time.	11.477333333333332
But we discussed that with the original publication and finally one a couple of epidemiological publication.	11.529166666666667
First of all, this was interesting.	11.674333333333333
Interesting publication in and the MMWR.	11.716333333333333
From Arizona, and I think I think the results are really compelling of how you can actually flatten the curve if you implement some changes and not necessarily complete lockdown, which is one of the things that is being discussed.	11.767
And so this is the the number of daily cases in Arizona and you can see.	11.9895
After they lifted the stay at home and and the summer came, you can see how traumatic was the increase in cases in our neighboring state, Arizona.	12.065
But then they slowly started to implement measures.	12.239166666666668
They limit the public event closure of bars, movie theaters, gyms, movie theaters,  something similar to what we have done here.	12.299333333333333
They also mandated the use of mask and enforce the use of mask and you can see how dramatic the decrease in the number of cases occur at the end of the summer.	12.408
So it was a very steep, very high.	12.609166666666665
But then when when all these measures that are here listed here were implemented, you can see the decrease in the cases or it is possible to actually flatten significantly the curve with public health measures that I think that's good news for us.	12.6495
And finally the CDC again placed the transmission by airborne in their webpage.	12.917333333333334
It was removed.	13.0815
Originally, it was placed for like a day or so hours, and then it was removed.	13.092833333333335
Then they edited.	13.172333333333334
And then they finally made a final statement on these that the cancelled times we spread by airborne transmission and how COVID spreads the CDC webpage.	13.186666666666667
I think that's the last one.	13.370833333333334
Thank you.	13.404
Yeah.	13.449000000000002
Johana?	13.484166666666665
Yeah.	13.575666666666667
Oh, very interesting.	13.587833333333332
There.	13.624500000000001
Oh, thanks.	13.635666666666667
Thanks, Nestor.	13.661666666666667
Always.	13.6755
So.	13.681666666666667
I learned so much so quickly with with your power points.	13.697333333333335
Thank you so much.	13.752666666666666
And I wanted to introduce Doctor Leslie Hayes.	13.774833333333333
Leslie has a power point as well.	13.834
And we're going to take questions as you have questions from doctor Sosa's Power Point, please put them in the chat any time on and we will get to that.	13.898
And after after we introduce our hub team members.	14.0435
So Leslie Hayes and I'm struggling to get this up one second.	14.1025
Take your time.	14.182166666666665
I thought I might have to have words with Dr. Sosa So when you presented a slide show that showed, um, for us study that showed 56 to 70 is elderly.	14.257333333333333
But you redeemed yourself when you called 40 to 60 young with the next study, So Ah, boy, I don't know why this is just not popping up for me here.	14.399833333333333
Oh, my God.	14.604000000000001
Elena, do you have it?	14.684
Because I just I can't get it to come up today.	14.700333333333333
I don't know why.	14.730333333333334
What's going on here?	14.738166666666666
So yes, I do.	14.752666666666666
Okay.	14.799000000000001
Ah wait found it.	15.198666666666666
Can you see it?	15.390666666666668
Can you guys see my slides or No?	15.480666666666668
Yes.	15.525
Okay.	15.53
Great thanks.	15.533666666666667
Yes.	15.557333333333334
Okay.	15.563666666666668
Um, when I was gonna present, I thought this was a pretty cool article.	15.599666666666668
It's from JAMA.	15.642833333333334
And it was on the science of persuasion.	15.66
How you can, um I guess there's actually been a lot of studies on How do you persuade people to do things and, um, opportune lessons for COVID-19 prevention.	15.693999999999999
So they talked about the five habit promoting strategies which, um, if you want somebody to develop a habit, get exercising or, um, eating more vegetables or wearing a mask.	15.835666666666667
They said there's five things to do.	16.033666666666665
You want to make it easy to start and easy to repeat.	16.0545
You wanna make it rewarding to repeat, you want to tie the behavior to an existing habit.	16.108166666666666
And I know I do this with people all the time suggesting they take pills when they first like that, and talk about behaviors that conflict with existing habits and provide alternative behaviors and provide specific descriptions of desire behaviors and they discussed for, um, the first one of making the behavior easy to start.	16.178833333333333
Repeat, making handwashing stations and hand sanitizer available everywhere really makes a difference on how often people wash their hands, and you know it's obvious.	16.488166666666665
But, um, often we don't have hand sanitizer readily available, so making it readily available.	16.63383333333333
Then they talk about leaving mask right next to the front door.	16.717333333333332
So they're easy to grab.	16.758
You leave the house, and then I've certainly seen this most places I go in public anywhere where they have marks on the floor demonstrating 6 ft apart, and that just makes it so easy to stay 6 ft from.	16.774333333333335
Other people also talked about communication and clear, consistent messaging.	16.942666666666664
And they said, This is actually most important at the local level, and I feel like we've gotten pretty good messaging, clear, consistent messaging on a state level, which made me feel good about it.	17.056333333333335
One thing they talked about it...	17.205666666666666
The media has really been guilty about this so many pictures of, uh, people on the beaches or, um, at Sturgis or wherever, not doing what they're supposed to, because when you highlight the bad behavior.	17.25583333333333
It makes people think it's more prevalent than it actually is.	17.463
It tends to make people less willing to, um, actually do what you want them to do.	17.503666666666668
So you really want to be highlighting people doing what they're supposed to And then the other one that, unfortunately, the medical field, that a really bad job that initially is conceding uncertainty.	17.571666666666665
And we're interested the TV for medical people, you know, we just said there was no evidence for wearing it in public, and I still to this day I have people posting on Facebook that, you know, Doctor Fauci or the surgeon general said not to wear masks and, you know, it's from back in March.	17.752333333333336
But people absolutely believe that message from back in March.	18.0275
So rather than saying, you know, this is what is true, we want to say, based on what we know today, it's sort of conceived we'd still don't know.	18.0875
We're still learning lessons about this and then Scientific American and, um, published something This week, COVID is actually the third leading cause of death in the US for this year.	18.192666666666664
It became the third leading cause of death March 4th and it was actually the first leading cause of death from April 5th to May 3rd.	18.390666666666668
And it's been the third leading cause of death with about the year and then indirect effects on Children in New York state.	18.49816666666667
This one was actually really quite heartbreaking.	18.6335
Um, the United Hospital Fund found that 4200 Children in New York had lost a parent to COVID-19 this year.	18.675666666666665
About 950 were Children, single parents and say, Well, they lost their only parent.	18.800666666666665
Um oh, it was one in 1000 Children in New York state lost a parent to COVID-19, um, one in 600 black Children, one in 700 Hispanic Children in one of 1500 white Children, Um, 57% were in Queens, Brooklyn or the Bronx, which were the hardest hit areas.	18.905666666666665
That was really that was fairly heartbreaking.	19.1955
And then they also found that 325,000 Children were pushed into poverty or near poverty in New York, which was roughly 8% of Children in New York who had not been poverty before COVID-19 started.	19.24233333333333
And they estimated it was gonna cost anywhere from 550 to 800 million just to support the basic needs of these Children and household severe new, newly newly in or near poverty over the next year.	19.432833333333335
And they estimate that 40% of low income workers lost their jobs throughout the United States.	19.640666666666668
And those, of course, are the people who are the least able to absorb financial hit like that.	19.716333333333335
And I decided not to go into this.	19.845666666666666
This is fairly similar to the one I presented from Minnesota Department of Health last week, but there was a COVID-19 response toolkit it from the public elementary schools on how to deal with Children who are symptomatic or have a positive COVID in their family or an exposure, and then also updating from American Academy of Pediatrics on COVID-19 testing guidance.	19.875666666666667
And like I said, they're fairly similar to what we've already talked about.	20.218833333333336
But it was nice to have something from local, and the last was just some articles that I thought were really good.	20.259999999999998
I didn't necessarily think it was worth summarizing, but I thought they were worth either reading yourself or passing along to that difficult uncle on Facebook, COVID-19 myth busting by Robin.	20.366333333333333
I don't know how to pronounce it.	20.532
Schoenthaler I think she posts a lot on Facebook.	20.5455
She's worth following on Facebook just for her post, but she wrote an article for Medium on the various myths around COVID, and this was quite good.	20.593166666666665
Um, UCSF had a grand rounds on October 6th.	20.73483333333333
Um, and they discuss President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and just sort of what it meant from a medical standpoint.	20.785500000000003
What you could tell what, um, what we know about the medications that were used to treat him.	20.8905
It's veal on YouTube and then, um actually, um, the grand rounds has an hour and a half.	20.999333333333333
I didn't have time to watch it, but Julie Thompson MD is on Facebook, and she summarized it under her personal Facebook page.	21.120166666666666
She's from Oakland.	21.21783333333333
There's multiple Julie Thompson's, but, um, her summary was really excellent, and I think it's worth looking at if you're on Facebook and then Emily Auster's schools aren't super spreaders from the Atlantic.	21.228833333333334
I'm still waiting to see definitive medical articles on this, but this was quite a good summary.	21.403000000000002
And then Elizabeth Ralph here, how the pandemic finally ends was also an article that was definitely worth reading.	21.494000000000003
And that was everything I had.	21.601499999999998
Thank you.	21.695666666666668
Thank you so much.	21.706833333333336
Leslie.	21.723333333333336
It is.	21.733333333333334
Ah, so great to get your take on what's important out there in the ambulatory world.	21.740666666666666
It's It's really great to get both both these, uh, both yours and Nestor's, some inputs I'd like to introduce, just to say hi.	21.84
Marla does not have a any update today.	22.011166666666668
But, Marla, if you can just so everyone knows who you are real quick.	22.05933333333333
Hello everyone.	22.12633333333333
Senior epidemiologists at the Department of Health.	22.14816666666667
Thanks, Marla.	22.19183333333333
And then Karissa Culbreath.	22.212833333333332
Um, could you just let everybody know who you are from TriCor scientists.	22.2485
I am.	22.377333333333336
I'm I'm one of the medical director for infectious disease diagnosis here, a TriCor.	22.389833333333335
And also my colleague, Doctor Cecilia Thompson, is also here on the call today.	22.468833333333336
Thank you so much, Karisa.	22.5365
And then, um my colleague at Project ECHO.	22.569000000000003
Uh, Carla Thornton is one of the senior associate Director is Carla.	22.6385
Um are you here?	22.715666666666667
Yeah, I'm here.	22.764333333333333
Hi, everyone.	22.774166666666666
Afternoon.	22.788999999999998
Carla Thornton here Division of Infectious Diseases.	22.799666666666667
Is that, um great.	22.826666666666664
Carla, Um Carla, do you wanna start with some questions?	22.86
Yeah.	22.937833333333334
Thank you to another.	22.9425
Quite a few questions on the chat.	22.956833333333336
Um, well, to start with a doctor, Sybil had a question on those with prolonged symptoms.	22.981833333333334
Does that correlate with prolonged viral shedding and infectivity?	23.067666666666664
Think Nestor, from your initial.	23.134666666666664
You know, I haven't seen that correlation.	23.159499999999998
Uh, I know that severe patient who have severe acute COVID meaning patients were in the ICU or hospitalized.	23.223333333333336
They tend to have a longer viral shedding than those who have milder asymptomatic disease.	23.361333333333334
But I haven't seen the correlation between long COVID the invasion recover and viral shedding.	23.465833333333332
And I think that's that's one of the questions.	23.561666666666667
If this is a viral phenomenon or any immune phenomenon and we still don't know, I know they're looking into that actively, they're they're they're having this cohort of patients in which they're doing immunological studies to see what type of immune reaction they have.	23.595833333333335
They trying to look for the virus in different issues to see if there's any persistent in the C and s or somewhere else.	23.827333333333335
But I haven't seen anything published yet.	23.924166666666668
Thank you Nestor.	23.980666666666664
Um, I think Marla.	24.007333333333335
This is probably for you, because they're they're a few preregistration questions.	24.03083333333333
And then there's one in the chat about, you know, at least in New Mexico, this larger increase the number of cases that that we've seen in the last couple of weeks, if there's least what what you guys were thinking about, what the explanation of that, uh, increase.	24.083666666666666
You know, right now, we think that there's multiple factors, we kind of had many things change all at the same time.	24.433
So we have the long Labor Day holiday, and we know from our case interviews that there were a lot of people who traveled, had people from out of state travel to visit them.	24.496666666666666
Lots of family get togethers, Um, and at the same time, you know that very same weekend we liberalized indoor dining.	24.672833333333333
Indoor dining was open again.	24.826
Um, the number of people that you were allowed to have in an indoor space, um, increased things were, you know, looking good heading into that weekend.	24.8575
Um, you know, some schools returned to in person learning, and, um, there were multiple other kind of recreational activities that were given the green light to open back up.	24.994333333333334
So you suddenly had, um, this long holiday weekend where you had travel.	25.188666666666666
You have family get togethers, events, and you also had people spending more time in.	25.264666666666667
You know, indoor spaces like restaurants, breweries, bars, um, skating rings, pumpkin patches, this, you know, sort of etcetera.	25.365666666666666
There were a lot of things that were kind of given the green light at the same time.	25.524833333333333
And so we think it's really a cumulative effect of all of those things, not only one thing.	25.581833333333336
But people definitely have reported increasing group activities and traveled, including dining.	25.670666666666666
Thank you Marla, and there was another question just about whether how much you can, how much you can explain by the increase in testing cause do you think that the increased in testing has added to the numbers significantly or not?	25.787333333333333
You know, the testing numbers right now really are sort of back up to where we have been through the spring and early part of the summer.	26.03783333333333
We had a drop off and testing, you know, kind of late July and August, but where we are now, it's kind of where we had been through the late spring and early summer, so there's not been a significant increase in in testing throughout the state.	26.142833333333332
Thank you very much.	26.394000000000002
A couple other questions.	26.425666666666665
Um, Claudia Guzman said If COVID-19 is airborne, then we'd have to improve the of insulation in many or most places to create negative pressure.	26.462
How's this being addressed?	26.614166666666666
Nestor, You have any ideas?	26.680666666666664
No.	26.722666666666665
I mean, I can comment on what the at least a hypothetical er or scientific data says, You know, ideally, yeah, if you're gonna be in a closed space, ideally that that room should have negative pressure.	26.735500000000002
But obviously that's not feasible in most, you know, stores, you know, supermarkets, etcetera.	26.953333333333333
So, you know, have to go to to have good ventilation if possible, to stop it like an air current.	27.058833333333332
In some places, open the windows and the doors.	27.15983333333333
If it's possible with the weather that that should help.	27.203666666666667
Also conducting activities outdoors as opposed to indoor.	27.256666666666668
And we've been doing that with restaurants and other things.	27.33083333333333
I peak off, etcetera, so you know, everything helps a little bit.	27.392666666666667
I think it's ah, it's a matter off improving, and if you're gonna be in a closed space, Hopefully there won't be that many people decreasing the chance of running into somebody with COVID.	27.462833333333332
So so, no crowding, indoor spaces is also critical.	27.637166666666666
So there.	27.71066666666667
I think there are many, many factors.	27.7225
I wanted to add something to the comment Before tomorrow, we are seeing the number of places in the hospital also pick up.	27.746333333333332
So I agree.	27.847666666666665
It's not just the testing thing, is definitely real.	27.857833333333335
We're starting to see patients in the ICU today.	27.9015
I have consented a couple of patients in the in the active trial, which is, you know, you usually get once a week.	27.942833333333333
We have three or four today between doctor Harkins and I.	28.043
So So we're seeing the numbers go up and the hospitalization go up.	28.115000000000002
Definitely it's not It's not our imagination.	28.170833333333334
Thank you Nestor.	28.262333333333334
And Barbara Oakland just put in the chat.	28.2685
What about people who are working inpatient care and clinics?	28.311666666666667
Where there's you can't open the window, there's no you know, there's no clear way to do that.	28.375833333333333
It's a big question.	28.478166666666667
My clinic is actually going to get an environmental engineer to come in and see how we can improve ventilations.	28.515666666666668
So that is, I mean, it's not cheap, but that is one possible suggestion.	28.595833333333335
Is, um, environmental engineer's can come in and sort of evaluate for that, right?	28.670166666666667
Exactly.	28.754666666666665
Improving a meaning increasing the air changes in the room helps, obviously, And that's what we do in the hospital.	28.76383333333333
If you cannot, you cannot actually open the windows then then having ah more efficient system that will will get free or fresh air and frequent changes.	28.903000000000002
It's it's helpful, as supposed to having a completely circulated area in a closed environment.	29.158333333333335
I think, you know certain there's actually one more related question.	29.268666666666665
Maybe it's answered.	29.307166666666667
Jeff Miller asked any thoughts on data on whether HEPA air filters may help in outpatient settings in exam rooms and things like that.	29.322333333333333
This is Marla.	29.494000000000003
The PA did put out, um, sort of a statement with some guidance about using indoor HEPA filters and portable air filtration systems and enclosed environments, um, as to augment really kind of bringing in fresh air and that if you're not able to bring in fresh air, that this would sort of be better than nothing.	29.511666666666667
So they do have some information about the use of HEPA filters indoors, but really, you know, they say it's to augment, fresh air and many of the other engineering and administrative measures you have in place for protection.	29.917666666666666
I think you know, that's one thing that's important to remember is there's no sort of one thing that is going to protect everyone from COVID transmission.	30.154333333333334
It's really looking at, you know, the different situations and the different indoor environments and trying to layer on that protection as much as possible.	30.288
So you know people who are masked, Um, if you're in a healthcare setting wearing appropriate PPE, increasing air exchange is bringing in fresh air, if you can, using portable filtration if you can, screening people before they come into a space for signs and symptoms, you know good handwashing, good surface disinfection.	30.43933333333333
So you're kind of trying to layer on all of these measures to, you know, create some protection in those environments.	30.771666666666665
But, you know, unfortunately, there's really no one thing which is going to protect everyone all the time or is really available to everyone in different settings.	30.904
And he Marla, there's a question Jen Blanchard, can you a new yourself, a question that you put into the chat.	31.077333333333335
If not, I can ask it for you.	31.192333333333334
I don't I do not see her on video.	31.212833333333332
Um, Jan Blanchard asked a question she wanted to clarify, but what?	31.3145
She thinks Doctor Spray said last Thursday last Thursday that young people less than 30.	31.381833333333336
If their chief complaint is primarily in nausea without your eye symptoms, do you go ahead and obtain a COVID test and anyone speak to that?	31.482333333333333
Maybe Marlott, you can.	31.674
I don't know.	31.692333333333334
I didn't hear exactly what doctors Grace said during that meeting.	31.709999999999997
But anyone who has symptoms, we would encourage them to be tested.	31.7835
We've certainly talked to young people.	31.862333333333332
And, um, a lot of younger people who say, you know, they they thought it was allergies, right?	31.900666666666666
So they had some very mild, maybe nasal congestion.	31.990333333333336
No other symptoms, really.	32.054
And then when they did get tested, were positives.	32.081833333333336
So I think someone has symptoms, you know, even some of the more unusual symptoms, like GI eye symptoms without another explanation,  they should be tested.	32.129666666666665
Yeah.	32.304
Thank you.	32.307833333333335
I think that's what her really question was.	32.312333333333335
It sounds like people just have nausea alone, that whether or not they should be tested, But it sounds like, um, pretty much anybody should be tested with with any sort of symptoms at this point.	32.33133333333333
So back to you Jen?	32.50566666666666
Uh, thanks, Carla.	32.52283333333333
Uh huh.	32.55916666666666
Um, I just wanted to, uh, see, maybe if Doctor McCabe moving about McCabe is on the call.	32.58233333333333
If she maybe wants to ask her question about the CDC and kids and face masks, Yes.	32.72683333333333
Uh, hello, Everyone hi.	32.87116666666667
Uh, the CDC guideline says Children less than two should not be wearing face masks.	32.908
Some pediatricians are saying Children less than five should not be wearing a face mask.	33.02166666666667
I'm just wondering, what are we What are we How do we guide our clients on this?	33.11866666666666
Here's doctor Hayes.	33.2515
I'm just going to comment that I have seen a lot of 2 to 5 year olds in clinic recently, and not one has had trouble wearing that face mask correctly.	33.26533333333334
So, um, it definitely can be done.	33.379
I don't know if in a setting like a day care how easy it would be to keep it on all day, but I will tell you for a medical setting, it has not been an issue at all.	33.43566666666667
Thanks doctor Hayes, Nestor or Marla.	33.690666666666665
Any thoughts on that?	33.75233333333333
No, I don't have any anything.	33.793
I mean, I have I have an eight year old at home and she wears the mask.	33.827
But I know when she's in school, she sometimes just put it below the nose, and I have tried to tell her not to do that, but it's like, you know, she's eight years old.	33.88616666666667
It's hard, Thank you.	34.016333333333336
And Doctor McCabe, you had another question.	34.0815
I'll just read it because it relates to the airborne issues that we were talking about before.	34.126333333333335
And your question is about UV light.	34.230333333333334
And is that another option?	34.28283333333333
If I'm thinking if you're indoors, Um, might that be another option?	34.311166666666665
Doctor Sosa have you seen any studies?	34.410666666666664
I read a Jet Blue I think one of the airlines is using kind of UV light as one of the ways to perhaps some, uh, you know, clean the airplane or do something, right?	34.515
I mean, I've seen this mostly on press release and think mostly on the press, like people using these robots with UV light in airports and large areas where the, you know, in in anything at the moment where there's no clients around.	34.745666666666665
They actually have done this, but I haven't really seen that much.	35.003166666666665
I mean, I remember at the beginning of the of the epidemic we had to do.	35.059
So use UV-lights or or hydrogen peroxide peroxide, toe clean or mask, our N95 or or sterilize our N95.	35.11866666666666
So yeah, so UV lights can be used in both areas or, you know, areas where people are congregate after people have left, obviously, because of the risk of, of skin damage and radiation damage.	35.2455
And and also for for objects, you know, like mask and surfaces, etcetera.	35.474666666666664
And you see all the times in the labs to to kill bacteria and other viruses.	35.583999999999996
So yeah, but I mean, that's that's as far as I can say.	35.661500000000004
Thank you, Nestor, I'm just talking about kind of the N95.	35.717333333333336
A couple questions on N95 mask a Dan Saltman says.	35.823166666666665
Should we be using more N95 masks or surgical masks in the health care settings?	35.90466666666667
And I'm thinking, Dan, you're getting it as the uptake of cases go up or just in General Dan, if you want to Maybe, unmute you did kind of further elicit at your question That would be great.	35.996
Yeah, that I think.	36.185833333333335
Thank you.	36.20366666666666
Thank you, Joanna.	36.2145
That was a follow up to the idea that it's ah, airborne.	36.233333333333334
You know, if it's airborne and it's good persisting and we're protecting healthcare workers, maybe those surgical masks are not adequate.	36.294333333333334
This is follow up to the, you know, the closed room the close rooms and the clinics where you can't really You can't really fix the ventilation very easily in a big building.	36.441833333333335
Something like that.	36.608666666666664
Think Dan, Nestor, what are your thoughts on that?	36.6605
It's a tough question.	36.71216666666667
I mean, we here, um, I could give you the a really life experience.	36.72983333333333
At the beginning, we were we were not able to to use the N95 on everybody.	36.79333333333333
So we we're limiting N95 to like, very high risk situations patients who you were going to perform like aerosol generating procedure.	36.87383333333333
But at that time, it wasn't There was that much science saying that it was actually airborne all the time.	37.01233333333333
Now, more recently, that we are a little bit better with the N95 existence or or the number of N95 we are using N95 every time we contact or we're going to do care for a patient with COVID or a high suspicion of COVID the suspicion that we're waiting for a result because, you know, he had a close contact or something.	37.100833333333334
So, yes, So we're using more N95.	37.404833333333336
Obviously, my concern And this is my personal opinion is that if We used to much When If we have another high peak, we're gonna run into trouble again with the N95.	37.44566666666666
So it's sort of ah, if a different, difficult decision.	37.60633333333333
So and then the other thing is that the everything showed that if if you you know, if you have adequate ventilation in the room, the procedure mask or the surgical mask confers decent protection.	37.65866666666667
We have seen the data from other hospitals that that have published their percentage of healthcare workers that are infected, and interestingly enough, the percentage is relatively low, very similar to the community, even in the hype of the epidemic.	37.87116666666667
And I'm talking about stories down in Boston, and York during the spring.	38.111999999999995
So so obviously, although theoretically a surgical mask, it's not enough In the practical sense if you, as I was saying, if you layer that, you know, with with adequate ventilation, negative pressure room taking, you know, using the face shield in front of the of the surgical mask, limiting your contact with the patient.	38.199666666666666
Oh, you know what?	38.51283333333333
It is really necessary and not going out of the room many times during the day.	38.52466666666667
All of those measures increase the incidence and and protect the coworkers.	38.61016666666667
But always Well, yeah, if you wanna go into a room and you're gonna do a physical or something and you you suspect the patient has COVID I would recommend the N95 based on what we know now from from you know, different stories.	38.700833333333335
Thanks.	38.917
Nestor and Naomi Kistin ask, does the hospital have enough in N95's for staff?	38.92266666666667
And I think your answer would be possibly now.	39.01116666666667
But not if we keep using it every day for all the staff.	39.06316666666667
Is that right?	39.113166666666665
I don't know how how many we have, but I know we're using it just for COVID patients or suspicion of COVID patients.	39.17333333333333
But no for the regular, you know, sprayer that comes into the ED.	39.275333333333336
In that case, we just wear, you know, the regular procedure mask, and and we do question the patient, you know, if they have a fever, cough, shortness of breath, anosmia.	39.33616666666667
But we're not using it all the time, because, yeah, we would run out of N95 in a few days if we use it in all patient contacts in all situations.	39.47983333333333
Thank.	39.61866666666666
Thanks Nestor, this is Leslie.	39.6245
I just wanted to add that, um we worry a lot about the interactions with patients, and we need to remember also that we need to protect ourselves with other coworkers because that's actually a substantial force of healthcare spread.	39.6595
So, um, when we're talking about it, make sure we're using protection Surgical mask, um, or something when we're around coworkers as well.	39.850833333333334
Yeah, exactly.	40.02016666666667
The Liberator.	40.033
Yeah.	40.05050000000001
Yeah.	40.0555
And some.	40.059333333333335
Some studies show that most most of the healthcare workers are infected by other coworkers in the cafeteria, and they remove the mask eat to talk, you know, in the break rooms more than with patient contact.	40.07383333333333
Interestingly enough, so So it is something to remember all the time that the coworkers, especially when we remove our PPE and start talking It's when when you really are at risk.	40.25066666666667
Excellent points.	40.479166666666664
Thank you.	40.50266666666666
Thank you, Leslie.	40.5145
Thank you, Nestor.	40.528666666666666
Um, Doctor Sosa.	40.5545
Um, Doctor Tempus wanted to know if you were impressed with the Australian lab study that found COVID-19 virus can remain viable on glass and and money for 28 days.	40.588166666666666
Right?	40.80266666666667
I have to read the paper.	40.814499999999995
And you saw the headline.	40.83166666666667
I saw the headline 28 29 days.	40.86
You know, they, uh, it's sort of different to the one before that.	40.92466666666667
The top?	41.00083333333334
More more, about several days.	41.006499999999996
So Yeah, it's interesting.	41.0435
I have to read and, you know, in order to give give my my opinion, But I think that the practical message is the same.	41.06883333333334
I mean, you have to assume that it's going to be in a surface, that you have to clean a surface.	41.16116666666667
If there has been a patient there, wash your hands as much as you can.	41.227333333333334
I think the take home message.	41.2875
But I'll, I'll be back for this question next week.	41.311166666666665
And I'll look at the data of the paper specifically, but I think you know it.	41.36533333333333
It's not going to change our behavior that much.	41.431333333333335
It's just that we need to be careful with this virus if if if I don't think we need to say that this and say this in this group.	41.4615
But I think that that's the take home message. Thank you, Nestor, and I'm wondering of Jeanne Boyle is available.	41.59166666666667
Can Jeanne can you unmute you?	41.725
Oh, well, if you if you want to be unmuted, please go ahead Jeanne.	41.92016666666667
Yeah.	42.01716666666667
Hi, Joanna.	42.034666666666666
Hi there.	42.056000000000004
It's so good to hear you.	42.079166666666666
Um, do you want to mention about nursing facilities using UV light?	42.12833333333333
Yeah.	42.22
Um, I'm currently in Houston, working with Harris County, which, you know, has had a tremendous problem with trying to contain the COVID-19 spread in our very large metropolitan area.	42.231
And so I go on behalf of the county into nursing facilities, detention centers, homeless centers and group homes to mitigate outbreaks.	42.4585
And several of the very well functioning low infection of nursing facilities have been using, um, a room UV light of some sort when they do terminal cleaning.	42.61300000000001
So when somebody moves from one part of the facility to another, they vacate their room and as part of the terminal cleaning at the end of it.	42.879333333333335
Um, the UV light is placed in the room for a period of time.	43.034
I don't know how long it is if it's overnight or exactly how long, but, um, you know, just by looking at the evidence, just sort of subjectively or objectively, there's it's really quite remarkable that those particular nursing facilities that are employing that type of device really have a low incidence of spread and low incidence of outbreak.	43.10933333333333
Whoa.	43.53333333333333
Well, thanks, Jamie.	43.54516666666667
That's incredible.	43.568999999999996
We need to look into that more.	43.589166666666664
That's really impressive.	43.62766666666666
So good to hear your voice.	43.65333333333333
Yeah, you too.	43.68666666666666
Back to you, Carla.	43.71333333333334
Thanks, Joanna.	43.74916666666666
I wanted to, um, ask Dan Saltman again to unmute himself again.	43.76016666666667
He have a couple of questions that didn't make it onto his preregistration questions.	43.814
Dan do you want to unmute yourself?	43.89149999999999
Thank you.	43.92166666666667
Uh, thank you.	43.93966666666667
Uh, so one of them was a kind of more narrow question.	43.9615
That was about the, uh it's about the presidential treatment.	44.013333333333335
Um, you got Would you expect it that when you when somebody receives monoclonal antibodies, is a treatment for COVID That that would, uh, confer any long term immunity, uh, and stimulate the t's cellular immunity and long term immunity?	44.07983333333333
So that was one part of that question.	44.401500000000006
And the second part was, um just any comments on, uh, how one would judge the president's infectivity as in regards to COVID this is.	44.43233333333333
I want to take it.	44.7445
Okay, so the first year the monoclonal is I have read and this is mostly press release and and other comments or a couple of basic science papers with the monoclonal.	44.784
The life of the monoclonal is a few weeks.	44.949333333333335
So, yes, once you get an injection of monoclonal antibodies, it will circulate for for some time.	44.99366666666666
So So it's going to confer some at least neutralizing antibodies or antibodies against the spike protein, monoclonals are directed against the spike protein for sometime they don't go away in a couple of days.	45.10216666666667
Like like regular drug they actually linger for for a while.	45.30133333333333
In one of the papers that I read, I remember, you know, see, in four weeks or one month of life, So you you have some some protection.	45.38216666666666
I don't know what's gonna happen to the immune respond, to the his own immune response If you If you blunt the with monoclonal antibodies, I, um I don't know.	45.508833333333335
I have to wait and see the large phase three trials with monoclonal and how the immune response We still produce antibodies to the virus or or this is some somehow blunted and also see the cell immunity.	45.69533333333333
It is going to be blunted by the passive immunity.	45.92766666666667
But I don't know, I I would just be speculating.	45.968666666666664
And regarding the second question was about the treatment of the president about his ah, assessing the infectivity after he got that really potent kind of treatment.	46.035999999999994
So that so that he he may not have mounted much of, ah, cellular immunity response at all.	46.26866666666667
That was one for one side of that because because he had an antiviral, he got antibodies and got steroids.	46.37883333333333
So it blunted his own his own native response as well.	46.50466666666667
And that so then the follow up on that was, how would you, um, you know, in light of that kind of treatment, how would you assess his infectivity?	46.5775
His You know, his his ability to pass on the virus, right?	46.720166666666664
Okay.	46.79966666666667
Yeah.	46.8045
So I mean, we don't know for sure, but the best test will be to try to find virus that is cultural or viable in his respiratory secretions.	46.809
So that would be the ideal situation.	46.969833333333334
That's not something easy to do.	47.00083333333334
But you would have to do Oh, not just a PCR.	47.026666666666664
Because the PCR, as we have said many times in these are for, um, it's it's could be positive, uh, for for some weeks.	47.068999999999996
So you you would have to really do some sensitive.	47.19866666666667
They're they're two ways to do that.	47.2485
One is to measure subgenomic RNA, which is sort of not just a regular RNA, but something that that indicates that there's active virus replication.	47.27183333333333
And the other thing is to try to culture the virus.	47.41683333333334
If you're not able to do that or you don't find, um subgenomic RNA you, you can safely assume that he's not infectious.	47.45483333333333
If we go just by the rules of the of the CDC after 10 days off his initial diagnosis, granted that he's afebrile, you have to assume that he's not excreting virus.	47.59766666666667
But the only way to be sure is by doing that.	47.765166666666666
And there are a couple of, yeah, issues that as you alluded, number one is dexamethasone.	47.813
Dexamethasone or corticosteroids in general tend to prolong viral shedding.	47.9
So that's that's something against the president that in theory, because he got the dexamethasone, he may not be able to, um, to have a, you know, reduction of the of the viral shedding that soon.	47.98383333333334
The second?	48.20133333333333
Is that what we know?	48.21
Epidemiological.	48.2355
I mentioned these that if a patient has severe COVID, they would have longer viral shedding.	48.2535
So if he really has severe COVID and was hospitalized or he was on, we assume that it is similar to the regular population that is hospitalized with severe Covid.	48.350833333333334
He may have a more prolonged shedding, and in fact, in that situation, the CDC talks about 20 days a supposed to 10 days that you have to consider the person infectious just for the sake off greater safety.	48.524833333333326
So So you know, it's hard to tell in reality.	48.7495
But if they did subgenomic RNA or the PCR was negative and viral culture, and it's negative you can you can safely assume that's probably not not infectious on top of that he received the monoclonal.	48.80533333333334
We should protect him from from having a lot of viral replication.	49.00266666666666
Uh huh.	49.07283333333333
So that's thank you.	49.08616666666667
Thank you very much, Nestor.	49.1235
I'm measuring that should go to maybe Marla.	49.14783333333333
There a couple of questions about whether it makes sense anymore to take the temperature of everybody who's going into a clinic or a restaurant or whether that's been shown to actually prevent, um, infection.	49.184333333333335
And I think is the question.	49.407000000000004
I don't know, Marla, for a public health standpoint.	49.42383333333333
If you if you think that that is something that should continue Yeah, I think it's similar to, um to what I said earlier about trying to sort of layer on some protections.	49.45399999999999
Many people who are infected don't ever develop a fever.	49.662166666666664
I've seen some numbers that say more than 50% of people never develop a fever.	49.72683333333334
Um, especially if they're in that early symptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase.	49.83283333333333
They're not gonna have a fever.	49.90016666666667
Um, so you're not going to catch everybody by taking their temperature, But you might catch a couple of people.	49.92783333333333
Um, so I think you're really trying to, You know, through the questions about exposure and symptoms and taking a temperature again, trying to sort of catch as many people as you can before they enter the space.	50.0285
Um, probably just temperature checks alone are not gonna be very effective.	50.25933333333333
Um, you really need to be asking the questions about symptoms and known exposures to confirm cases.	50.330333333333336
I think there's also a behavioral thing.	50.491
I mean, when you would you see somebody taking your temperature and asking you questions make you think twice about your symptoms.	50.52816666666667
If you have nothing, you go into a building, you know, like free.	50.63533333333333
We have seen.	50.68183333333333
I mean, in some of the cases that we have investigated, people have been symptomatic and they go to work.	50.69133333333333
And, you know, if if you don't stop it and ask if they're like Yeah, well, now that you ask me, yeah, you have a little bit of, you know, aches and pains.	50.77166666666667
And I had a fever last night, but not not today.	50.8805
So that's a type of situation that we face in reality with this patient.	50.92066666666666
That then later, later are are detected with COVID, so I think it's important.	50.99983333333333
It's a It's a behavioral thing that puts a stop on the door and make people think about their symptoms and remind them that we are in the midst of a pandemic.	51.074333333333335
This is mostly I just want to get the other question.	51.227666666666664
I would love to see people start asking that I don't think people are asking is have you been tested for COVID in the last few days?	51.27583333333334
Cause the last month I've had, like, five people call me and say I need a COVID test because I just met with someone and they came in and said they were fine.	51.366
And then we found out that had a COVID test yesterday that came back positive today.	51.5055
So I think asking Have you had a COVID test?	51.56216666666667
Um, is something else to consider asking a people come in the door.	51.608333333333334
Thank you, Leslie.	51.706
That's think it was really helpful.	51.717666666666666
I just wanted to remind for everybody that the same link just went into the chat about 12 45 and I think she repeated it.	51.742
So please fill that out if you would like CME and you have any feedback for us.	51.86816666666667
Um, and also the slide sets from both Nestor and Leslie slides went into the chat as well.	51.93933333333334
So you can have a link to the pdf of those slides	52.038333333333334
I'm not sure I don't assure you answered this.	52.08583333333333
Um Nestor, But Leslie he was asking Are you going to be more or less likely to develop your own antibodies if you get monocle antibody as a treatment?	52.124
Well, I don't know.	52.294333333333334
I don't know for sure.	52.32666666666667
I mean, in theory could be less if if you actually let's let's assume you blunt the infection completely.	52.342333333333336
With the monocle really successful, it may not now matter.	52.435500000000005
Induce a natural immune response If if if if the monoclonal In reality, I don't think it's that, you know, 100%.	52.49433333333333
You always have virus and you will have to give it really early, You know that.	52.635
But yeah, in theory should hamper the immune response.	52.71583333333333
But I haven't seen any hard data, so we have to We have to really wait.	52.76166666666666
But it would.	52.816
And the other thing that you can give you a false positive IgG.	52.841499999999996
So if you measure IgG, you're measuring Maybe the levels of antibodies against the the protein.	52.90116666666667
I mean the spike protein, so that's another thing.	53.00233333333333
So So I think we need to study and see what type of immune reaction the patient that I've given monoclonal are the same as those that are given vaccine.	53.041666666666664
What type of immune reaction they haven't will have.	53.1705
We will have that information because that's one of the things that they're looking in the phase 3 of Regeneron on and Eli Lilly and also AstraZeneca, which are the three most advanced monoclonal companies right now.	53.20516666666666
Along those lines, is there any recommendations When we do get a vaccine, if somebody has received monoclonal antibody, Do you need to wait a couple months before giving the vaccine?	53.44766666666667
That I don't know.	53.532666666666664
You don't You don't want to Give them together because you make blonde that the effect of the vaccine also.	53.59216666666667
But I haven't seen any data, but we used it with the other vaccines.	53.66616666666666
You don't want to use immunoglobulin, you know very close to the vaccine if if you can, if you can avoid it, and especially if you're going to do it, both you And if it's intramuscular, you have to give it at different places so it doesn't neutralize it.	53.710166666666666
You think your Nestor.	53.96066666666666
Sorry, I'm in a lecture.	53.99883333333333
No problem.	54.06733333333333
Okay, um, there's one that this is a real hard push, but I'm just going to say it anyway, because we don't really Well, I don't think we know, But there's a question from Claudia Guzman.	54.07483333333333
COVID-19 is transmitted via fomite, droplet and airborne is that known, which is the number one way that people are getting it.	54.207166666666666
Do we Do you know, do we know the answer to that question?	54.31816666666667
Maybe Marley, you can also chime in.	54.400666666666666
Yeah, the main way.	54.44566666666666
It's still thought to be the respiratory droplets.	54.475166666666674
So person to person, um, you know, obviously there is an opportunity for for my transmission, but we don't think that's the primary way that it's spread.	54.532333333333334
Um, you know.	54.694833333333335
And when CDC released the statement about aerosol transmission, they were very careful to say This doesn't appear to be the same kind of aerosol transmission that we see with TB or measles or varicella.	54.71183333333333
Um, it's more of a limited aerosol transmission, So it's still thought that droplet at close person to person droplets spread is the primary way that the infections being transmitted.
Thank you Marla, back to you Johana.	54.92366666666667
Great.	55.234
I'm just I'm wondering Karissa and Cecilia.	55.272333333333336
I'm wondering if you have any comments related to any of the these testing questions or anything else.	55.33183333333333
We just have a couple minutes left.	55.43983333333333
And you, uh, wanted to see if you'd like to add anything to today's session.	55.46566666666667
Uh, no, I don't have anything to add.	55.57066666666666
Happy to have a quiet testing day?	55.602999999999994
Um, maybe just the one thing is that there's not currently any FDA approved or an authorized test for the subgenomic RNA that Nestor was mentioning.	55.64866666666667
Although there are some that are in various processes of development and submission.	55.845
So, um, that may come to light at some point in the near future, or let's nothing near future some point in the future.	55.940333333333335
Um, but for now, we'll rely on the CDC guidance for how to determine went to remove isolation.	56.06433333333334
Thank you.	56.188833333333335
Great.	56.2015
Thank you so much.	56.21
Karissa, we really appreciate your presence here.	56.22566666666667
I just wanted to let everybody know we have about a minute left.	56.30050000000001
We still have the weekly first responder.	56.3625
Resiliency Echo.	56.405166666666666
That's on Mondays at two o'clock mountain time.	56.43083333333333
If you need information Maybe can't.	56.50833333333333
You could put in the information about the first responder resiliency.	56.53916666666667
ECHO If if Kent, our digital library in can't get that momentarily, it's always on our project ECHO, website and then the 1st and 3rd.	56.612833333333334
I think it's the 1st and 3rd Thursdays from 8 to 9 Mountain time.	56.79316666666667
We're still having the critical care ECHO with doctor Michelle Harkins.	56.84866666666667
It's not this week, but it will be next week.	56.9095
Carl, is that correct?	56.958666666666666
Um, I think it's this week, isn't it?	56.99483333333333
Was I I, uh it think it's 4 30.	57.02816666666667
It's It's on the 15th.	57.11366666666667
Yeah, and actually, it's going to be Donna upset.	57.13316666666666
It's gonna be talking about COVID-19.	57.18333333333333
And, um, that's in.	57.21383333333333
I thinks I can't remember.	57.269666666666666
I don't know, Elaine, if you have the title of her talk, it's COVID-19 and air pollution on air pollution.	57.300333333333334
Okay, fantastic.	57.42216666666666
So it seems like it's going to be kind of the intersection between climate change and COVID-19, so it should be really interesting.	57.442
Well, thank you, everybody for participating.	57.58383333333334
Another great session and we'll see you next week.	57.63216666666666
	57.63216666666666
