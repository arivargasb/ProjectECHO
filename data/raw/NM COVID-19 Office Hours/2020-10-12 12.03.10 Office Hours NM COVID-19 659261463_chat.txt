12:53:40	 From  Harry Sibold MD, Helena MT, on Creek Fire outside Yosemite now : Hi Dan, I wonder if there is also the issue of prolonged UV light degradation of masks (if they are paper surgical masks or N-95s…cloth masks are prolly not affected, right?)
12:55:04	 From  Dan Saltman   to   Project ECHO IT - Calvin(Privately) : Dr. Sosa’s sound fades in and out. I’ve noticed this the past few weeks, too. I don’t think this is simply from his position relative to the mic. Thank you.
12:56:20	 From  Harry Sibold MD, Helena MT, on Creek Fire outside Yosemite now : That is a really important question, Leslie.  If they have tested, isolated per CDC and are clear, it really complicates the decision tree if you get a second positive test.  Is that person still shedding infectious virus?  I don’t even know how to work that up, short of viral cultures
12:56:22	 From  Project ECHO IT - Calvin   to   Dan Saltman(Privately) : Yes, noticed also. I will message him to test his mic. 
12:58:25	 From  Project ECHO IT - Calvin   to   Nestor Sosa(Privately) : Hello! Your mic seems to fade in and out while you're speaking. After the session try testing your mic on the audio settings.
